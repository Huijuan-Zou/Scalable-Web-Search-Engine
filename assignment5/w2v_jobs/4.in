b'multilayered extended semantic networks multinets are both a knowledge representation paradigm and a language for meaning representation of natural language expressions that has been developed by prof dr hermann helbig on the basis of earlier semantic network semantic networks multinet is claimed to be one of the most comprehensive and thoroughly described knowledge representation systems it specifies conceptual structures by means of about 140 predefined relations and functions which are systematically characterized and underpinned by a formal axiomatic apparatus apart from their relational connections the concepts are embedded in a multidimensional space of layered attributes and their values another characteristic of multinet discerning it from simple semantic networks is the possibility to encapsulate whole partial networks and represent the resulting conceptual capsule as a node of higher order which itself can be an argument of relations and functions multinet has been used in practical natural language processing nlp applications such as natural language interfaces to the internet or question answering systems over large semantically annotated corpus linguistics corpora with millions of sentences multinet is also a cornerstone of the commercially available search engine sempria search where it is used for the description of the computational lexicon and the background knowledge for the syntactic semantic analysis for logical answer finding as well as for the generation of natural language answers multinet is supported by a set of software tools and has been used to build large semantically based computational lexicons the tools include a semantic interpreter wocadi which translates natural language expressions phrases sentences texts into formal multinet expressions a workbench mwr for the knowledge engineer comprising modules for automatic knowledge acquisition and reasoning and a workbench lia for the computer lexicographer supporting the creation of large semantically based computational lexica references hermann helbig die semantische struktur nat\xc3\xbcrlicher sprache wissensrepr\xc3\xa4sentation mit multinet springer heidelberg 2001 hermann helbig knowledge representation and the semantics of natural language 2006 springer berlin sven hartrumpf hermann helbig johannes leveling rainer osswald an architecture for controlling simple language in web pages eminds international journal on human computer interaction 1 2 2006 external links http pi7 fernuni hagen de forschung multinet multinet en html multinet and its software environment category semantic web category knowledge representation software stub'
b'f logic frame data structure frame logic programming logic is a knowledge representation and ontology language f logic combines the advantages of conceptual modeling with object oriented frame based languages and offers a declarative compact and simple syntax as well as the well defined semantics of a logic based language features include among others object identity complex objects inheritance computer science inheritance polymorphism computer science polymorphism query methods encapsulation computer science encapsulation f logic stands in the same relationship to object oriented programming as classical predicate calculus stands to relational database programming f logic was developed by michael kifer at stony brook university and georg lausen at the university of mannheim f logic was originally developed for deductive databases but is now most frequently used for semantic technologies especially the semantic web f logic is considered as one of the formalisms for ontology information science ontologies but description logic dl is more popular and accepted as is the dl based web ontology language owl a development environment for f logic was developed in the neon project and is also used in a range of applications for information integration question answering and semantic search prior to the version 4 of prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 ontology editor f logic is

adequate collections of axioms for a viable description of a robot environment ref cite journal last hayes first patrick title the frame problem and related problems in artificial intelligence journal

defined this problem in their 1969 article some philosophical problems from the standpoint of artificial intelligence in this paper and many that came after the formal mathematical problem was a starting point for more general discussions of the difficulty of knowledge representation for artificial intelligence issues such as how to provide rational default assumptions and what humans consider common sense in a virtual environment ref cite journal last mccarthy first j author2 p j hayes title some philosophical problems from the standpoint of artificial intelligence journal machine intelligence year 1969 volume 4 pages 463 502 ref later the term acquired a broader meaning in philosophy where it is formulated as the problem of limiting the beliefs that have to be updated in response to actions in the logical context actions are typically specified by what they change with the implicit assumption that everything else the frame remains unchanged description the frame problem occurs even in very simple domains a scenario with a door which can be open or closed and a light which can be on or off is statically represented by two proposition s math textit open math and math textit on math if these conditions can change they are better represented by two predicate computer programming predicate s math textit open t math and math textit on t math that depend on time such predicates are called fluent artificial intelligence fluent s a domain in which the door is closed and the light off at time 0 and the door opened at time 1 can be directly represented in logic clarify reason what kind of logic if ordinary predicate logic is meant what is the purpose of the true \xe2\x86\x92 in the 3rd formula if some other logic situation calculus is meant it should be stated explicitly here together with the purpose of the true \xe2\x86\x92 e g some empty action in that logic date august 2013 by the following formulae math neg textit open 0 math math neg textit on 0 math math textit true rightarrow textit open 1 math the first two formulae represent the initial situation the third formula represents the effect of executing the action of opening the door at time 1 if such an action had preconditions such as the door being unlocked it would have been represented by math neg textit locked 0 rightarrow textit open 1 math in practice one would have a predicate math textit executeopen t math for specifying when an action is executed and a rule math forall t textit executeopen t wedge textit true rightarrow textit open t 1 math for specifying the effects of actions the article on the situation calculus gives more details while the three formulae above are a direct expression in logic of what is known they do not suffice to correctly draw consequences while the following conditions representing the expected situation are consistent with the three formulae above they are not the only ones math neg textit open 0 math nbsp nbsp math textit open 1 math math neg textit on 0 math math neg textit on 1 math indeed another set of conditions that is consistent with the three formulae above is math neg textit open 0 math nbsp nbsp math textit open 1 math math neg textit on 0 math math textit on 1 math the frame problem is that specifying only which conditions are changed by the actions do not allow in logic to conclude that all other conditions are not changed this problem can be solved by adding the so called frame axioms which explicitly specify that all conditions not affected by actions are not changed while executing that action for example since the action executed at time 0 is that of opening the door a frame axiom would state that the status of the light does not change from time 0 to time 1 math textit on 0 leftrightarrow textit on 1 math the frame problem is that one such frame axiom is necessary for every pair of action and condition such that the action does not affect the condition clarify reason shouldn t then the frame axiom be the following modification of the above rule \xe2\x88\x80t executeopen t \xe2\x86\x92open t 1 \xe2\x88\xa7 on t 1 \xe2\x86\x94on t in contrast the formula on 0 \xe2\x86\x94on 1 seems to be too particular taylored to the executeopen 0 situation date august 2013 in other words the problem is that of formalizing a dynamical domain without explicitly specifying the frame axioms the solution proposed by mccarthy to solve this problem involves assuming that a minimal amount of condition changes have occurred this solution is formalized using the framework of circumscription logic circumscription the yale shooting problem however shows that this solution is not always correct alternative solutions were then proposed involving predicate completion fluent occlusion successor state axiom s etc they are explained below by the end of the 1980s the frame problem as defined by mccarthy and hayes was solved clarify reason mention the combination of approach es by which the frame problem was solved date august 2013 even after that however the term frame problem was still used in part to refer to the same problem but under different settings e g concurrent actions and in part to refer to the general problem of representing and reasoning with dynamical domains solutions the following solutions depict how the frame problem is solved in various formalisms the formalisms themselves are not presented in full what is presented are simplified versions that are sufficient to explain the full solution fluent occlusion solution this solution was proposed by erik sandewall who also defined a formal language for the specification of dynamical domains therefore such a domain can be first expressed in this language and then automatically translated into logic in this article only the expression in logic is shown and only in the simplified language with no action names the rationale of this solution is to represent not only the value of conditions over time but also whether they can be affected by the last executed action the latter is represented by another condition called occlusion a condition is said to be occluded in a given time point if an action has been just executed that makes the condition true or false as an effect occlusion can be viewed as permission to change if a condition is occluded it is relieved from obeying the constraint of inertia in the simplified example of the door and the light occlusion can be formalized by two predicates math textit occludeopen t math and math textit occludeon t math the rationale is that a condition can change value only if the corresponding occlusion predicate is true at the next time point in turn the occlusion predicate is true only when an action affecting the condition is executed math neg textit open 0 math math neg textit on 0 math math textit true rightarrow textit open 1 wedge textit occludeopen 1 math math forall t neg textit occludeopen t rightarrow textit open t 1 leftrightarrow textit open t math math forall t neg textit occludeon t rightarrow textit on t 1 leftrightarrow textit on t math in general every action making a condition true or false also makes the corresponding occlusion predicate true in this case math textit occludeopen 1 math is true making the antecedent of the fourth formula above false for math t 1 math therefore the constraint that math textit open t 1 leftrightarrow textit open t math does not hold for math t 1 math therefore math textit open math can change value which is also what is enforced by the third formula in order for this condition to work occlusion predicates have to be true only when they are made true as an effect of an action this can be achieved either by circumscription logic circumscription or by predicate completion it is worth noticing that occlusion does not necessarily imply a change for example executing the action of opening the door when it was already open in the formalization above makes the predicate math textit occludeopen math true and makes math textit open math true however math textit open math has not changed value as it was true already predicate completion solution this encoding is similar to the fluent occlusion solution but the additional predicates denote change not permission to change for example math textit changeopen t math represents the fact that the predicate math textit open math will change from time math t math to math t 1 math as a result a predicate changes if and only if the corresponding change predicate is true an action results in a change if and only if it makes true a condition that was previously false or vice versa math neg textit open 0 math math neg textit on 0 math math neg textit open 0 wedge textit true rightarrow textit changeopen 0 math math forall t textit changeopen t leftrightarrow neg textit open t leftrightarrow textit open t 1 math math forall t textit changeon t leftrightarrow neg textit on t leftrightarrow textit on t 1 math the third formula is a different way of saying that opening the door causes the door to be opened precisely it states that opening the door changes the state of the door if it had been previously closed the last two conditions state that a condition changes value at time math t math if and only if the corresponding change predicate is true at time math t math to complete the solution the time points in which the change predicates are true have to be as few as possible and this can be done by applying predicate completion to the rules specifying the effects of actions successor state axioms solution the value of a condition after the execution of an action can be determined by the fact that the condition is true if and only if the action makes the condition true or the condition was previously true and the action does not make it false a successor state axiom is a formalization in logic of these two facts for example if math textit opendoor t math and math textit closedoor t math are two conditions used to denote that the action executed at time math t math was to open or close the door respectively the running example is encoded as follows math neg textit open 0 math math neg textit on 0 math math textit opendoor 0 math math forall t textit open t 1 leftrightarrow textit opendoor t vee textit open t wedge neg textit closedoor t math this solution is centered around the value of conditions rather than the effects of actions in other words there is an axiom for every condition rather than a formula for every action preconditions to actions which are not present in this example are formalized by other formulae the successor state axioms are used in the variant to the situation calculus proposed by ray reiter fluent calculus solution the fluent calculus is a variant of the situation calculus it solves the frame problem by using first order logic first order logic formation rules terms rather than predicates to represent the states converting predicates into terms in first order logic is called reification knowledge representation reification the fluent calculus can be seen as a logic in which predicates representing the state of conditions are reified the difference between a predicate and a term in first order logic is that a term is a representation of an object possibly a complex object composed of other objects while a predicate represents a condition that can be true or false when evaluated over a given set of terms in the fluent calculus each possible state is represented by a term obtained by composition of other terms each one representing the conditions that are true in state for example the state in which the door is open and the light is on is represented by the term math textit open circ textit on math it is important to notice that a term is not true or false by itself as it is an object and not a condition in other words the term math textit open circ textit on math represent a possible state and does not by itself mean that this is the current state a separate condition can be stated to specify that this is actually the state at a given time e g math textit state textit open circ textit on 10 math means that this is the state at time math 10 math the solution to the frame problem given in the fluent calculus is to specify the effects of actions by stating how a term representing the state changes when the action is executed for example the action of opening the door at time 0 is represented by the formula math textit state s circ textit open 1 leftrightarrow textit state s 0 math the action of closing the door which makes a condition false instead of true is represented in a slightly different way math textit state s 1 leftrightarrow textit state s circ textit open 0 math this formula works provided that suitable axioms are given about math textit state math and math circ math e g a term containing two times the same condition is not a valid state for example math textit state textit open circ s circ textit open t math is always false for every math s math and math t math event calculus solution the event calculus uses terms for representing fluents like the fluent calculus but also has axioms constraining the value of fluents like the successor state axioms in the event calculus inertia is enforced by formulae stating that a fluent is true if it has been true at a given previous time point and no action changing it to false has been performed in the meantime predicate completion is still needed in the event calculus for obtaining that a fluent is made true only if an action making it true has been performed but also for obtaining that an action had been performed only if that is explicitly stated default logic solution the frame problem can be thought of as the problem of formalizing the principle that by default everything is presumed to remain in the state in which it is gottfried wilhelm leibniz leibniz an introduction to a secret encyclop\xc3\xa6dia c 1679 this default sometimes called the commonsense law of inertia was expressed by raymond reiter in default logic math frac r x s r x textit do a s r x textit do a s math if math r x math is true in situation math s math and it can be assumed ref i e no contradicting information is known ref that math r x math remains true after executing action math a math then we can conclude that math r x math remains true steve hanks and drew mcdermott argued on the basis of their yale shooting problem yale shooting example that this solution to the frame problem is unsatisfactory hudson turner showed however that it works correctly in the presence of appropriate additional postulates answer set programming solution the counterpart of the default logic solution in the language of answer set programming is a rule with stable model semantics strong negation strong negation math r x t 1 leftarrow r x t hbox not sim r x t 1 math if math r x math is true at time math t math and it can be assumed that math r x math remains true at time math t 1 math then we can conclude that math r x math remains true action description languages action description language s elude the frame problem rather than solving it an action description language is a formal language with a syntax that is specific for describing situations and actions for example that the action math textit opendoor math makes the door open if not locked is expressed by math textit opendoor math causes math textit open math if math neg textit locked math the semantics of an action description language depends on what the language can express concurrent actions delayed effects etc and is usually based on transition system s since domains are expressed in these languages rather than directly in logic the frame problem only arises when a specification given in an action description logic is to be translated into logic typically however a translation is given from these languages to answer set programming rather than first order logic see also yale shooting problem binding problem ramification problem qualification problem common sense commonsense reasoning defeasible reasoning non

b'one source date july 2011 in philosophy and artificial intelligence ai especially knowledge based systems the qualification problem is concerned with the impossibility of listing all the precondition s required for a real world action to have its intended effect it might be posed as how to deal with the things that prevent me from achieving my intended result it is strongly connected to and opposite the ramification problem ramification side of the frame problem john mccarthy gives the following motivating example in which it is impossible to enumerate all the circumstances that may prevent a rowboat from performing its ordinary function t he successful use of a boat to cross a river requires if the boat is a rowboat that the oars and rowlocks be present and unbroken and that they fit each other many other qualifications can be added making the rules for using a rowboat almost impossible to apply and yet anyone will still be able to think of additional requirements not yet stated see also non monotonic logic circumscription logic circumscription external links john mccarthy http www formal stanford edu jmc circumscription node1 html introduction the qualification problem category knowledge representation category logic programming category epistemology epistemology stub'
b'the yale shooting problem is a conundrum or scenario in formal situational logic on which early logical solutions to the frame problem fail the name of this problem derives from its inventors steve hanks and drew mcdermott working at yale university when they proposed it in this scenario fred later identified as a turkey bird turkey is initially alive and a gun is initially unloaded loading the gun waiting for a moment and then shooting the gun at fred is expected to kill fred however if inertia is formalized in logic by minimizing the changes in this situation then it cannot be uniquely proved that fred is dead after loading waiting and shooting in one solution fred indeed dies in another also logically correct solution the gun becomes mysteriously unloaded and fred survives technically this scenario is described by two fluent artificial intelligence fluents a fluent is a condition that can change truth value over time math alive math and math loaded math initially the first condition is true and the second is false then the gun is loaded some time passes and the gun is fired such problems can be formalized in logic by considering four time points math 0 math math 1 math math 2 math and math 3 math and turning every fluent such as math alive math into a predicate math alive t math depending on time a direct formalization of the statement of the yale shooting problem in logic is the following one math alive 0 math math neg loaded 0 math math true rightarrow loaded 1 math math loaded 2 rightarrow neg alive 3 math the first two formulae represent the initial state the third formula formalizes the effect of loading the gun at time math 0 math the fourth formula formalizes the effect of shooting at fred at time math 2 math this is a simplified formalization in which action names are neglected and the effects of actions are directly specified for the time points in which the actions are executed see situation calculus for details the formulae above while being direct formalizations of the known facts do not suffice to correctly characterize the domain indeed math neg alive 1 math is consistent with all these formulae although there is no reason to believe that fred dies before the gun has been shot the problem is that the formulae above only include the effects of actions but do not specify that all fluents not changed by the actions remain the same in other words a formula math alive 0 equiv alive 1 math must be added to formalize the implicit assumption that loading the gun only changes the value of math loaded math and not the value of math alive math the necessity of a large number of formulae stating the obvious fact that conditions do not change unless an action changes them is known as the frame problem an early solution to the frame problem was based on minimizing the changes in other words the scenario is formalized by the formulae above that specify only the effects of actions and by the assumption that the changes in the fluents over time are as minimal as possible the rationale is that the formulae above enforce all effect of actions to take place while minimization should restrict the changes to exactly those due to the actions in the yale shooting scenario one possible evaluation of the fluents in which the changes are minimized is the following one cellpadding 5 math alive 0 math math alive 1 math math alive 2 math math neg alive 3 math math neg loaded 0 math math loaded 1 math math loaded 2 math math loaded 3 math this is the expected solution it contains two fluent changes math loaded math becomes true at time 1 and math alive math becomes false at time 3 the following evaluation also satisfies all formulae above cellpadding 5 math alive 0 math math alive 1 math math alive 2 math math alive 3 math math neg loaded 0 math math loaded 1 math math neg loaded 2 math math neg loaded 3 math in this evaluation there are still two changes only math loaded math becomes true at time 1 and false at time 2 as a result this evaluation is considered a valid description of the evolution of the state although there is no valid reason to explain math loaded math being false at time 2 the fact that minimization of changes leads to wrong solution is the motivation for the introduction of the yale shooting problem while the yale shooting problem has been considered a severe obstacle to the use of logic for formalizing dynamical scenarios solutions to it are known since the late 1980s one solution involves the use of predicate completion in the specification of actions according to this solution the fact that shooting causes fred to die is formalized by the preconditions alive and loaded and the effect is that alive changes value since alive was true before this corresponds to alive becoming false by turning this implication into an if and only if statement the effects of shooting are correctly formalized predicate completion is more complicated when there is more than one implication involved a solution proposed by erik sandewall was to include a new condition of occlusion which formalizes the permission to change for a fluent the effect of an action that might change a fluent is therefore that the fluent has the new value and that the occlusion is made temporarily true what is minimized is not the set of changes but the set of occlusions being true another constraint specifying that no fluent changes unless occlusion is true completes this solution the yale shooting scenario is also correctly formalized by the ray reiter reiter version of the situation calculus the fluent calculus and the action description language s in 2005 the 1985 paper in which the yale shooting scenario was first described received the aaai classic paper award in spite of being a solved problem that example is still sometimes mentioned in recent research papers where it is used as an illustrative example e g for explaining the syntax of a new logic for reasoning about actions rather than being

b'default logic is a non monotonic logic proposed by raymond reiter to formalize reasoning with default assumptions default logic can express facts like by default something is true by contrast standard logic can only express that something is true or that something is false this is a problem because reasoning often involves facts that are true in the majority of cases but not always a classical example is birds typically fly this rule can be expressed in standard logic either by all birds fly which is inconsistent with the fact that penguins do not fly or by all birds that are not penguins and not ostriches and fly which requires all exceptions to the rule to be specified default logic aims at formalizing inference rules like this one without explicitly mentioning all their exceptions syntax of default logic a default theory is a pair math langle w d rangle math mvar w is a set of logical formulae called the background theory that formalize the facts that are known for sure mvar d is a set of default rules each one being of the form math frac mathrm prerequisite justification 1 dots mathrm justification n mathrm conclusion math according to this default if we believe that math prerequisite is true and each of math mathrm justification i math is consistent with our current beliefs we are led to believe that math conclusion is true the logical formulae in mvar w and all formulae in a default were originally assumed to be first order logic formulae but they can potentially be formulae in an arbitrary formal logic the case in which they are formulae in propositional logic is one of the most studied examples the default rule birds typically fly is formalized by the following default math d left frac mathrm bird x mathrm flies x mathrm flies x right math this rule means that if mvar x is a bird and it can be assumed that it flies then we can conclude that it flies a background theory containing some facts about birds is the following one math w mathrm bird mathrm condor mathrm bird mathrm penguin neg mathrm flies mathrm penguin mathrm flies mathrm bee math according to this default rule a condor flies because the precondition math bird condor is true and the justification math flies condor is not inconsistent with what is currently known on the contrary math bird penguin does not allow concluding math flies penguin even if the precondition of the default math bird penguin is true the justification math flies penguin is inconsistent with what is known from this background theory and this default math bird bee cannot be concluded because the default rule only allows deriving math flies x from math bird x but not vice versa deriving the antecedents of an inference rule from the consequences is a form of explanation of the consequences and is the aim of abductive reasoning a common default assumption is that what is not known to be true is believed to be false this is known as the closed world assumption and is formalized in default logic using a default like the following one for every fact mvar f math frac neg f neg f math for example the computer language prolog uses a sort of default assumption when dealing with negation if a negative atom cannot be proved to be true then it is assumed to be false note however that prolog uses the so called negation as failure when the interpreter has to evaluate the atom math neg f math it tries to prove that mvar f is true and conclude that math neg f math is true if it fails in default logic instead a default having math neg f math as a justification can only be applied if math neg f math is consistent with the current knowledge restrictions a default is categorical or prerequisite free if it has no prerequisite or equivalently its prerequisite is tautology logic tautological a default is normal if it has a single justification that is equivalent to its conclusion a default is supernormal if it is both categorical and normal a default is seminormal if all its justifications entail its conclusion a default theory is called categorical normal supernormal or seminormal if all defaults it contains are categorical normal supernormal or seminormal respectively semantics of default logic a default rule can be applied to a theory if its precondition is entailed by the theory and its justifications are all consistent with the theory the application of a default rule leads to the addition of its consequence to the theory other default rules may then be applied to the resulting theory when the theory is such that no other default can be applied the theory is called an extension of the default theory the default rules may be applied in different order and this may lead to different extensions the nixon diamond example is a default theory with two extensions math left langle left frac mathrm republican x neg mathrm pacifist x neg mathrm pacifist x frac mathrm quaker x mathrm pacifist x mathrm pacifist x right left mathrm republican mathrm nixon mathrm quaker mathrm nixon right right rangle math since richard nixon nixon is both a american republican republican and a quaker both defaults can be applied however applying the first default leads to the conclusion that nixon is not a pacifist which makes the second default not applicable in the same way applying the second default we obtain that nixon is a pacifist thus making the first default not applicable this particular default theory has therefore two extensions one in which math pacifist nixon is true and one in which math pacifist nixon is false the original semantics of default logic was based on the fixed point mathematics fixed point of a function the following is an equivalent algorithmic definition if a default contains formulae with free variables it is considered to represent the set of all defaults obtained by giving a value to all these variables a default math frac alpha beta 1 ldots beta n gamma math is applicable to a propositional theory mvar t if math t models alpha math and all theories math t cup beta i math are consistent the application of this default to mvar t leads to the theory math t cup gamma math an extension can be generated by applying the following algorithm t w current theory a 0 set of defaults applied so far nbsp apply a sequence of defaults while there is a default d that is not in a and is applicable to t add the consequence of d to t add d to a nbsp final consistency check if for every default d in a t is consistent with all justifications of d then output t this algorithm is nondeterministic algorithm non deterministic as several defaults can alternatively be applied to a given theory mvar t in the nixon diamond example the application of the first default leads to a theory to which the second default cannot be applied and vice versa as a result two extensions are generated one in which nixon is a pacifist and one in which nixon is not a pacifist the final check of consistency of the justifications of all defaults that have been applied implies that some theories do not have any extensions in particular this happens whenever this check fails for every possible sequence of applicable defaults the following default theory has no extension math left langle left frac a b neg a b right emptyset right rangle math since math a b math is consistent with the background theory the default can be applied thus leading to the conclusion that math a b math is false this result however undermines the assumption that has been made for applying the first default consequently this theory has no extensions in a normal default theory all defaults are normal each default has the form math frac phi psi psi math a normal default theory is guaranteed to have at least one extension furthermore the extensions of a normal default theory are mutually inconsistent i e inconsistent with each other entailment a default theory can have zero one or more extensions entailment of a formula from a default theory can be defined in two ways skeptical a formula is entailed by a default theory if it is entailed by all its extensions credulous a formula is entailed by a default theory if it is entailed by at least one of its extensions thus the nixon diamond example theory has two extensions one in which nixon is a pacifist and one in which he is not a pacifist consequently neither math pacifist nixon nor math not pacifist nixon are skeptically entailed while both of them are credulously entailed as this example shows the credulous consequences of a default theory may be inconsistent with each other alternative default inference rules these are the alternative default inference rules that are based on the same original syntax of default logic the following alternative inference rules for default logic are all based on the same syntax as the original system justified differs from the original one in that a default is not applied if thereby the set mvar t becomes inconsistent with a justification of an applied default concise a default is applied only if its consequence is not already entailed by mvar t the exact definition is more complicated than this one this is only the main idea behind it constrained a default is applied only if the set composed of the background theory the justifications of all applied defaults and the consequences of all applied defaults including this one is consistent rational similar to constrained default logic but the consequence of the default to add is not considered in the consistency check cautious defaults that can be applied but are conflicting with each other like the ones of the nixon diamond example are not applied the justified and constrained versions of the inference rule assign at least an extension to every default theory variants of default logic these are the variants of default logic that differ from the original one both in syntax and semantics the following variants of default logic differ from the original one on both syntax and semantics assertional variants an assertion is a pair math langle p r 1 ldots r n rangle math composed of a formula and a set of formulae such a pair indicates that mvar p is true while the formulae math r 1 ldots r n math have been assumed consistent to prove that mvar p is true an assertional default theory is composed of an assertional theory a set of assertional formulae called the background theory and a set of defaults defined as in the original syntax whenever a default is applied to an assertional theory the pair composed of its consequence and its set of justifications is added to the theory the following semantics use assertional theories cumulative default logic commitment to assumptions default logic quasi default logic weak extensions rather than checking whether the preconditions are valid in the theory composed of the background theory and the consequences of the applied defaults the preconditions are checked for validity in the extension that will be generated in other words the algorithm for generating extensions starts by guessing a theory and using it in place of the background theory what results from the process of extension generation is actually an extension only if it is equivalent to the theory guessed at the beginning this variant of default logic is related in principle to autoepistemic logic where a theory math box x rightarrow x math has the model in which mvar x is true just because assuming math box x math true the formula math box x rightarrow x math supports the initial assumption disjunctive default logic the consequence of a default is a set of formulae instead of a single formula whenever the default is applied at least one of its consequences is nondeterministically chosen and made true priorities on defaults the relative priority of defaults can be explicitly specified among the defaults that are applicable to a theory only one of the most preferred ones can be applied some semantics of default logic do not require priorities to be explicitly specified rather more specific defaults those that are applicable in fewer cases are preferred over less specific ones statistical variant a statistical default is a default with an attached upper bound on its frequency of error in other words the default is assumed to be an incorrect inference rule in at most that fraction of times it is applied translations default theories can be translated into theories in other logics and vice versa the following conditions on translations have been considered consequence preserving the original and the translated theories have the same propositional consequences faithful this condition only makes sense when translating between two variants of default logic or between default logic and a logic in which a concept similar to extension exists e g models in modal logic a translation is faithful if there exists a mapping typically a bijection between the extensions or models of the original and translated theories modular a translation from default logic to another logic is modular if the defaults and the background theory can be translated separately moreover the addition of formulae to the background theory only leads to adding the new formulae to the result of the translation same alphabet the original and translated theories are built on the same alphabet polynomial the running time of the translation or the size of the generated theory are required to be polynomial in the size of the original theory translations are typically required to be faithful or at least consequence preserving while the conditions of modularity and same alphabet are sometimes ignored the translatability between propositional default logic and the following logics have been studied classical propositional logic autoepistemic logic propositional default logic restricted to seminormal theories alternative semantics of default logic circumscription translations exist or not depending on which conditions are imposed translations from propositional default logic to classical propositional logic cannot always generate a polynomially sized propositional theory unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses translations to autoepistemic logic exists or not depending on whether modularity or the use of the same alphabet is required complexity the analysis of algorithms

b'belief revision is the process of changing beliefs to take into account a new piece of information the formal logic logical formalization of belief revision is researched in philosophy in databases and in artificial intelligence for the design of intelligent agent rational agent s what makes belief revision non trivial is that several different ways for performing this operation may be possible for example if the current knowledge includes the three facts math a math is true math b math is true and if math a math and math b math are true then math c math is true the introduction of the new information math c math is false can be done preserving consistency only by removing at least one of the three facts in this case there are at least three different ways for performing revision in general there may be several different ways for changing knowledge revision and update two kinds of changes are usually distinguished update the new information is about the situation at present while the old beliefs refer to the past update is the operation of changing the old beliefs to take into account the change revision both the old beliefs and the new information refer to the same situation an inconsistency between the new and old information is explained by the possibility of old information being less reliable than the new one revision is the process of inserting the new information into the set of old beliefs without generating an inconsistency the main assumption of belief revision is that of minimal change the knowledge before and after the change should be as similar as possible in the case of update this principle formalizes the assumption of inertia in the case of revision this principle enforces as much information as possible to be preserved by the change example the following classical example shows that the operations to perform in the two settings of update and revision are not the same the example is based on two different interpretations of the set of beliefs math a vee b math and the new piece of information math neg a math update in this scenario two satellites unit a and unit b orbit around mars the satellites are programmed to land while transmitting their status to earth earth has received a transmission from one of the satellites communicating that it is still in orbit however due to interference it is not known which satellite sent the signal subsequently earth receives the communication that unit a has landed this scenario can be modeled in the following way two propositional variable s math a math and math b math indicate that unit a and unit b respectively are still in orbit the initial set of beliefs is math a vee b math either one of the two satellites is still in orbit and the new piece of information is math neg a math unit a has landed and is therefore not in orbit the only rational result of the update is math neg a math since the initial information that one of the two satellites had not landed yet was possibly coming from the unit a the position of the unit b is not known revision the play six characters in search of an author will be performed in one of the two local theatres this information can be denoted by math a vee b math where math a math and math b math indicates that the play will be performed at the first or at the second theatre respectively a further information that jesus christ superstar will be performed at the first theatre indicates that math neg a math holds in this case the obvious conclusion is that six characters in search of an author will be performed at the second but not the first theatre which is represented in logic by math neg a wedge b math this example shows that revising the belief math a vee b math with the new information math neg a math produces two different results math neg a math and math neg a wedge b math depending on whether the setting is that of update or revision contraction expansion revision consolidation and merging in the setting in which all beliefs refer to the same situation a distinction between various operations that can be performed is made contraction removal of a belief expansion addition of a belief without checking consistency revision addition of a belief while maintaining consistency consolidation restoring consistency of a set of beliefs merging fusion of two or more sets of beliefs while maintaining consistency revision and merging differ in that the first operation is done when the new belief to incorporate is considered more reliable than the old ones therefore consistency is maintained by removing some of the old beliefs merging is a more general operation in that the priority among the belief sets may or may not be the same revision can be performed by first incorporating the new fact and then restoring consistency via consolidation this is actually a form of merging rather than revision as the new information is not always treated as more reliable than the old knowledge the agm postulates the agm postulates named after the names of their proponents carlos alchourr\xc3\xb3n alchourr\xc3\xb3n peter g\xc3\xa4rdenfors g\xc3\xa4rdenfors and david makinson makinson are properties that an operator that performs revision should satisfy in order for that operator to be considered rational the considered setting is that of revision that is different pieces of information referring to the same situation three operations are considered expansion addition of a belief without a consistency check revision addition of a belief while maintaining consistency and contraction removal of a belief the first six postulates are called the basic agm postulates in the settings considered by alchourr\xc3\xb3n g\xc3\xa4rdenfors and makinson the current set of beliefs is represented by a deductive closure deductively closed set of logical formulae math k math called belief base the new piece of information is a logical formula math p math and revision is performed by a binary operator math math that takes as its operands the current beliefs and the new information and produces as a result a belief base representing the result of the revision the math math operator denoted expansion math k p math is the deductive closure of math k cup p math the agm postulates for revision are closure math k p math is a belief base i e a deductively closed set of formulae success math p in k p math inclusion math k p subseteq k p math vacuity math text if neg p not in k text then k p k p math math k p math is inconsistent only if math p math is inconsistent or math k math is inconsistent extensionality math text if p text and q text are logically equivalent then k p k q math see logical equivalence math k p wedge q subseteq k p q math math text if neg q not in k p text then k p q subseteq k p wedge q math a revision operator that satisfies all eight postulates is the full meet revision in which math k p math is equal to math k p math if consistent and to the deductive closure of math p math otherwise while satisfying all agm postulates this revision operator has been considered to be too conservative in that no information from the old knowledge base is maintained if the revising formula is inconsistent with it citation needed date november 2011 conditions equivalent to the agm postulates the agm postulates are equivalent to several different conditions on the revision operator in particular they are equivalent to the revision operator being definable in terms of structures known as selection functions epistemic entrenchments systems of spheres and preference relations the latter are reflexive relation reflexive transitive relation transitive and total relation s over the set of models each revision operator math math satisfying the agm postulates is associated to a set of preference relations math leq k math one for each possible belief base math k math such that the models of math k math are exactly the minimal of all models according to math leq k math the revision operator and its associated family of orderings are related by the fact that math k p math is the set of formulae whose set of models contains all the minimal models of math p math according to math leq k math this condition is equivalent to the set of models of math k p math being exactly the set of the minimal models of math p math according to the ordering math leq k math a preference ordering math leq k math represents an order of implausibility among all situations including those that are conceivable but yet currently considered false the minimal models according to such an ordering are exactly the models of the knowledge base which are the models that are currently considered the most likely all other models are greater than these ones and are indeed considered less plausible in general math i k j math indicates that the situation represented by the model math i math is believed to be more plausible than the situation represented by math j math as a result revising by a formula having math i math and math j math as models should select only math i math to be a model of the revised knowledge base as this model represent the most likely scenario among those supported by math p math contraction contraction is the operation of removing a belief math p math from a knowledge base math k math the result of this operation is denoted by math k p math the operators of revision and contractions are related by the levi and harper identities math k p k neg p p math math k p k cap k neg p math eight postulates have been defined for contraction whenever a revision operator satisfies the eight postulates for revision its corresponding contraction operator satisfies the eight postulates for contraction and vice versa if a contraction operator satisfies at least the first six postulates for contraction translating it into a revision operator and then back into a contraction operator using the two identities above leads to the original contraction operator the same holds starting from a revision operator one of the postulates for contraction has been longly discussed the recovery postulate math k k p p math according to this postulate the removal of a belief math p math followed by the reintroduction of the same belief in the belief base should lead to the original belief base there are some examples showing that such behavior is not always reasonable in particular the contraction by a general condition such as math a vee b math leads to the removal of more specific conditions such as math a math from the belief base it is then unclear why the reintroduction of math a vee b math should also lead to the reintroduction of the more specific condition math a math for example if george was previously believed to have german citizenship it was also believed to be european contracting this latter belief amounts to stop believing that george is european therefore that george has german citizenship is also retracted from the belief base if george is later discovered to have austrian citizenship then the fact that he is european is also reintroduced according to the recovery postulate however the belief that he also has german citizenship should also be reintroduced the correspondence between revision and contraction induced by the levi and harper identities is such that a contraction not satisfying the recovery postulate is translated into a revision satisfying all eight postulates and that a revision satisfying all eight postulates is translated into a contraction satisfying all eight postulates including recovery as a result if recovery is excluded from consideration a number of contraction operators are translated into a single revision operator which can be then translated back into exactly one contraction operator this operator is the only one of the initial group of contraction operators that satisfies recovery among this group it is the operator that preserves as much information as possible the ramsey test ramsey test ramsey test ramsey s test ramsey s test redirect here the evaluation of a counterfactual conditional math a b math can be done according to the ramsey test named for frank p ramsey to the hypothetical addition of math a math to the set of current beliefs followed by a check for the truth of math b math if math k math is the set of beliefs currently held the ramsey test is formalized by the following correspondence math a b math if and only if math b in k a math if the considered language of the formulae representing beliefs is propositional the ramsey test gives a consistent definition for counterfactual conditionals in terms of a belief revision operator however if the language of formulae representing beliefs itself includes the counterfactual conditional connective math math the ramsey test leads to the gardenfors triviality result there is no non trivial revision operator that satisfies both the agm postulates for revision and the condition of the ramsey test this result holds in the assumption that counterfactual formulae like math a b math can be present in belief bases and revising formulae several solutions to this problem have been proposed non monotonic inference relation given a fixed knowledge base math k math and a revision operator math math one can define a non monotonic inference relation using the following definition math p vdash q math if and only if math k p models q math in other words a formula math p math logical consequence entails another formula math q math if the addition of the first formula to the current knowledge base leads to the derivation of math q math this inference relation is non monotonic the agm postulates can be translated into a set of postulates for this inference relation each of these postulates is entailed by some previously considered set of postulates for non monotonic inference relations vice versa conditions that have been considered for non monotonic inference relations can be translated into postulates for a revision operator all these postulates are entailed by the agm postulates foundational revision in the agm framework a belief set is represented by a deductively closed set of propositional formula e while such sets are infinite they can always be finitely representable however working with deductively closed sets of formulae leads to the implicit assumption that equivalent belief bases should be considered equal when revising this is called the principle of irrelevance of syntax this principle has been and is currently debated while math a b math and math a wedge b math are two equivalent sets revising by math neg a math should produce different results in the first case math a math and math b math are two separate beliefs therefore revising by math neg a math should not produce any effect on math b math and the result of revision is math neg a b math in the second case math a wedge b math is taken a single belief the fact that math a math is false contradicts this belief which should therefore be removed from the belief base the result of revision is therefore math neg a math in this case the problem of using deductively closed knowledge bases is that no distinction is made between pieces of knowledge that are known by themselves and pieces of knowledge that are merely consequences of them this distinction is instead done by the foundational approach to belief revision which is related to foundationalism in philosophy according to this approach retracting a non derived piece of knowledge should lead to retracting all its consequences that are not otherwise supported by other non derived pieces of knowledge this approach can be realized by using knowledge bases that are not deductively closed and assuming that all formulae in the knowledge base represent self standing beliefs that is they are not derived beliefs in order to distinguish the foundational approach to belief revision to that based on deductively closed knowledge bases the latter is called the coherentist approach this name has been chosen because the coherentist approach aims at restoring the coherence consistency among all beliefs both self standing and derived ones this approach is related to coherentism in philosophy foundationalist revision operators working on non deductively closed belief bases typically select some subsets of math k math that are consistent with math p math combined them in some way and then conjoined them with math p math the following are two non deductively closed base revision operators widtio when in doubt throw it out the maximal subsets of math k math that are consistent with math p math are intersected and math p math is added to the resulting set in other words the result of revision is composed by math p math and of all formulae of math k math that are in all maximal subsets of math k math that are consistent with math p math ginsberg fagin ullman vardi the maximal subsets of math k cup p math that are consistent and contain math p math are combined by disjunction nebel similar to the above but a priority among formulae can be given so that formulae with higher priority are less likely to being retracted than formulae with lower priority a different realization of the foundational approach to belief revision is based on explicitly declaring the dependences among beliefs in the truth maintenance system s dependence links among beliefs can be specified in other worlds one can explicitly declare that a given fact is believed because of one or more other facts such a dependency is called a justification beliefs not having any justifications play the role of non derived beliefs in the non deductively closed knowledge base approach model based revision and update a number of proposals for revision and update based on the set of models of the involved formulae were developed independently of the agm framework the principle behind this approach is that a knowledge base is equivalent to a set of possible worlds that is to a set of scenarios that are considered possible according to that knowledge base revision can therefore be performed on the sets of possible worlds rather than on the corresponding knowledge bases the revision and update operators based on models are usually identified by the name of their authors marianne winslett winslett forbus satoh dalal hegner and weber according to the first four of these proposal the result of revising updating a formula math k math by another formula math p math is characterized by the set of models of math p math that are the closest to the models of math k math different notions of closeness can be defined leading to the difference among these proposals dalal the models of math p math having a minimal hamming distance to models of math k math are selected to be the models that result from the change satoh similar to dalal but distance between two models is defined as the set of literals that are given different values by them similarity between models is defined as set containment of these differences winslett for each model of math k math the closest models of math p math are selected comparison is done using set containment of the difference borgida equal to winslett s if math k math and math p math are inconsistent otherwise the result of revision is math k wedge p math ken forbus forbus similar to winslett but the hamming distance is used the revision operator defined by hegner makes math k math not to affect the value of the variables that are mentioned in math p math what results from this operation is a formula math k math that is consistent with math p math and can therefore be conjoined with it the revision operator by weber is similar but the literals that are removed from math k math are not all literals of math p math but only the literals that are evaluated differently by a pair of closest models of math k math and math p math according to the satoh measure of closeness iterated revision the agm postulates are equivalent to a preference ordering an ordering over models to be associated to every knowledge base math k math however they do not relate the orderings corresponding to two non equivalent knowledge bases in particular the orderings associated to a knowledge base math k math and its revised version math k p math can be completely different this is a problem for performing a second revision as the ordering associated with math k p math is necessary to calculate math k p q math establishing a relation between the ordering associated with math k math and math k p math has been however recognized not to be the right solution to this problem indeed the preference relation should depend on the previous history of revisions rather than on the resulting knowledge base only more generally a preference relation gives more information about the state of mind of an agent than a simple knowledge base indeed two states of mind might represent the same piece of knowledge math k math while at the same time being different in the way a new piece of knowledge would be incorporated for example two people might have the same idea as to where to go on holiday but yet they differ on how they would change this idea if they win a million dollar lottery since the basic condition of the preference ordering is that their minimal models are exactly the models of their associated knowledge base a knowledge base can be considered implicitly represented by a preference ordering but not vice versa given that a preference ordering allows deriving its associated knowledge base but also allows performing a single step of revision studies on iterated revision have been concentrated on how a preference ordering should be changed in response of a revision while single step revision is about how a knowledge base math k math has to be changed into a new knowledge base math k p math iterated revision is about how a preference ordering representing both the current knowledge and how much situations believed to be false are considered possible should be turned into a new preference relation when math p math is learned a single step of iterated revision produces a new ordering that allows for further revisions two kinds of preference ordering are usually considered numerical and non numerical in the first case the level of plausibility of a model is representing by a non negative integer number the lower the rank the more plausible the situation corresponding to the model non numerical preference orderings correspond to the preference relations used in the agm framework a possibly total ordering over models the non numerical preference relation were initially considered unsuitable for iterated revision because of the impossibility of reverting a revision by a number of other revisions which is instead possible in the numerical case darwiche and judea pearl pearl ref name darwiche pearl darwiche a and pearl j 1997 on the logic of iterated belief revision artificial intelligence 89 1 2 1 29 ref formulated the following postulates for iterated revision if math alpha models mu math then math psi mu alpha equiv psi alpha math if math alpha models neg mu math then math psi mu alpha equiv psi alpha math if math psi alpha models mu math then math psi mu alpha models mu math if math psi alpha not models neg mu math then math psi mu alpha not models neg mu math specific iterated revision operators have been proposed by spohn boutilier williams lehmann and others spohn rejected revision this non numerical proposal has been first considered by spohn who rejected it based on the fact that revisions can change some orderings in such a way the original ordering cannot be restored with a sequence of other revisions this operator change a preference ordering in view of new information math p math by making all models of math p math being preferred over all other models the original preference ordering is maintained when comparing two models that are both models of math p math or both non models of math p math natural revision while revising a preference ordering by a formula math p math all minimal models according to the preference ordering of math p math are made more preferred by all other ones the original ordering of models is preserved when comparing two models that are not minimal models of math p math this operator changes the ordering among models minimally while preserving the property that the models of the knowledge base after revising by math p math are the minimal models of math p math according to the preference ordering transmutations these are two forms of revision conditionalization and adjustment which work on numerical preference orderings revision requires not only a formula but also a number indicating its degree of plausibility while the preference ordering is still inverted the lower a model the most plausible it is the degree of plausibility of a revising formula is direct the higher the degree the most believed the formula is ranked revision a ranked model which is an assignment of non negative integers to models has to be specified at the beginning this rank is similar to a preference ordering but is not changed by revision what is changed by a sequence of revisions are a current set of models representing the current knowledge base and a number called the rank of the sequence since this number can only monotonically non decrease some sequences of revision lead to situations in which every further revision is performed as a full meet revision merging the assumption implicit in the revision operator is that the new piece of information math p math is always to be considered more reliable than the old knowledge base math k math this is formalized by the second of the agm postulates math p math is always believed after revising math k math with math p math more generally one can consider the process of merging several pieces of information rather than just two that might or might not have the same reliability revision becomes the particular instance of this process when a less reliable piece of information math k math is merged with a more reliable math p math while the input to the revision process is a pair of formulae math k math and math p math the input to merging is a multiset of formulae math k math math t math etc the use of multisets is necessary as two sources to the merging process might be identical when merging a number of knowledge bases with the same degree of plausibility a distinction is made between arbitration and majority this distinction depends on the assumption that is made about the information and how it has to be put together arbitration the result of arbitrating two knowledge bases math k math and math t math entails math k vee t math this condition formalizes the assumption of maintaining as much as the old information as possible as it is equivalent to imposing that every formula entailed by both knowledge bases is also entailed by the result of their arbitration in a possible world view the real world is assumed one of the worlds considered possible according to at least one of the two knowledge bases majority the result of merging a knowledge base math k math with other knowledge bases can be forced to entail math k math by adding a sufficient number of other knowledge bases equivalent to math k math this condition corresponds to a kind of vote by majority a sufficiently large number of knowledge bases can always overcome the opinion of any other fixed set of knowledge bases the above is the original definition of arbitration according to a newer definition an arbitration operator is a merging operator that is insensitive to the number of equivalent knowledge bases to merge this definition makes arbitration the exact opposite of majority postulates for both arbitration and merging have been proposed an example of an arbitration operator satisfying all postulates is the classical disjunction an example of a majority operator satisfying all postulates is that selecting all models that have a minimal total hamming distance to models of the knowledge bases to merge a merging operator can be expressed as a family of orderings over models one for each possible multiset of knowledge bases to merge the models of the result of merging a multiset of knowledge bases are the minimal models of the ordering associated to the multiset a merging operator defined in this way satisfies the postulates for merging if and only if the family of orderings meets a given set of conditions for the old definition of arbitration the orderings are not on models but on pairs or in general tuples of models social choice theory many revision proposals involve orderings over models representing the relative plausibility of the possible alternatives the problem of merging amounts to combine a set of orderings into a single one expressing the combined plausibility of the alternatives this is similar with what is done in social choice theory which is the study of how the preferences of a group of agents can be combined in a rational way belief revision and social choice theory are similar in that they combine a set of orderings into one they differ on how these orderings are interpreted preferences in social choice theory plausibility in belief revision another difference is that the alternatives are explicitly enumerated in social choice theory while they are the propositional models over a given alphabet in belief revision complexity the problem about belief revision that is the most studied from the point of view of computational complexity theory computational complexity is that of query answering in the propositional case this is the problem of establishing whether a formula follows from the result of a revision that is math k p models q math where math k math math p math and math q math are propositional formulae more generally query answering is the problem of telling whether a formula is entailed by the result of a belief revision which could be update merging revision iterated revision etc another problem that has received some attention is that of model checking that is checking whether a model satisfies the result of a belief revision a related question is whether such result can be represented in space polynomial in that of its arguments since a deductively closed knowledge base is infinite complexity studies on belief revision operators working on deductively closed knowledge bases are done in the assumption that such deductively closed knowledge base are given in the form of an equivalent finite knowledge base a distinction is made among belief revision operators and belief revision schemes while the former are simple mathematical operators mapping a pair of formulae into another formula the latter depend on further information such as a preference relation for example the dalal revision is an operator because once two formulae math k math and math p math are given no other information is needed to compute math k p math on the other hand revision based on a preference relation is a revision scheme because math k math and math p math do not allow determining the result of revision if the family of preference orderings between models is not given the complexity for revision schemes is determined in the assumption that the extra information needed to compute revision is given in some compact form for example a preference relation can be represented by a sequence of formulae whose models are increasingly preferred explicitly storing the relation as a set of pairs of models is instead not a compact representation of preference because the space required is exponential in the number of propositional letters the complexity of query answering and model checking in the propositional case is in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy for most belief revision operators and schemas most revision operators suffer from the problem of representational blow up the result of revising two formulae is not necessarily representable in space polynomial in that of the two original formulae in other words revision may exponentially increase the size of the knowledge base implementations

b'no footnotes date april 2010 in logic defeasible reasoning is a kind of reasoning that is rationally compelling though not deductive reasoning deductively valid ref cite web url http plato stanford edu entries reasoning defeasible title defeasbile reasoning stanford encyclopedia of philosophy accessdate 1 july 2016 ref the distinction between defeasibility and indefeasibility may be seen in the context of this joke during a train trip through the countryside an engineer a physicist and a mathematician observe a flock of sheep the engineer remarks i see that the sheep in this region are white the physicist offers a correction some sheep in this region are white and the mathematician responds in this region there exist sheep that are white on at least one side the engineer in this story has reasoned defeasibly since engineering is a highly practical discipline it is receptive to generalizations in particular engineers cannot and need not defer decisions until they have acquired perfect and complete knowledge but mathematics mathematical reasoning having different goals inclines one to account for even the rare and special cases and thus typically leads to a stance that is indefeasible defeasible reasoning is a particular kind of non demonstrative reasoning where the reasoning does not produce a full complete or final demonstration of a claim i e where fallibility and corrigibility of a conclusion are acknowledged in other words defeasible reasoning produces a wiktionary contingent contingent statement or claim other kinds of non demonstrative reasoning are probabilistic reasoning inductive reasoning statistical reasoning abductive reasoning and paraconsistent reasoning defeasible reasoning is also a kind of ampliative reasoning because its conclusions reach beyond the pure meanings of the premises the differences between these kinds of reasoning correspond to differences about the conditional that each kind of reasoning uses and on what premise or on what authority the conditional is adopted deductive reasoning deductive from meaning postulate axiom or contingent assertion if p then q i e q or not p defeasible from authority if p then defeasibly q probabilistic logic probabilistic from combinatorics and indifference if p then probably q statistics statistical from data and presumption the frequency of q s among p s is high or inference from a model fit to data hence in the right context if p then probably q inductive reasoning inductive theory formation from data coherence simplicity and confirmation inducibly if p then q hence if p then deducibly but revisably q abductive reasoning abductive from data and theory p and q are correlated and q is sufficient for p hence if p then abducibly q as cause defeasible reasoning finds its fullest expression in jurisprudence ethics and moral philosophy epistemology pragmatics and conversational convention norm conventions in linguistics constructivist epistemology constructivist decision theory decision theories and in knowledge representation and planning in artificial intelligence it is also closely identified with prima facie presumptive reasoning i e reasoning on the face of evidence and ceteris paribus default reasoning i e reasoning all things being equal history though aristotle differentiated the forms of reasoning that are valid for logic and philosophy from the more general ones that are used in everyday life see dialectics and rhetoric 20th century philosophers mainly concentrated on deductive reasoning at the end of the 19th century logic texts would typically survey both demonstrative and non demonstrative reasoning often giving more space to the latter however after the blossoming of mathematical logic at the hands of bertrand russell alfred north whitehead and willard van orman quine latter 20th century logic texts paid little attention to the non deductive modes of inference there are several notable exceptions john maynard keynes wrote his dissertation on non demonstrative reasoning and influenced the thinking of ludwig wittgenstein on this subject wittgenstein in turn had many admirers including the positivist legal scholar h l a hart and the speech act linguist john l austin stephen toulmin in rhetoric chaim perelman too the moral theorists w d ross and c l stevenson and the vagueness epistemologist ontologist friedrich waismann the etymology of defeasible usually refers to middle english law of contracts where a condition of defeasance is a clause that can invalidate or annul a contract or deed though defeat dominate defer defy deprecate and derogate are often used in the same contexts as defeasible the verbs annul and invalidate and nullify overturn rescind vacate repeal debar void cancel countermand preempt etc are more properly correlated with the concept of defeasibility than those words beginning with the letter d many dictionaries do contain the verb to defease with past participle defeased philosophers in moral theory and rhetoric had taken defeasibility largely for granted when american epistemologists rediscovered wittgenstein s thinking on the subject john ladd roderick chisholm roderick firth ernest sosa robert nozick and john l pollock all began writing with new conviction about how appearance as red was only a defeasible reason for believing something to be red more importantly wittgenstein s orientation toward language games and away from semantics emboldened these epistemologists to manage rather than to expurgate prima facie logical inconsistency at the same time in the mid 1960s two more students of hart and austin at oxford brian barry and david gauthier were applying defeasible reasoning to political argument and practical reasoning of action respectively joel feinberg and joseph raz were beginning to produce equally mature works in ethics and jurisprudence informed by defeasibility by far the most significant works on defeasibility by the mid 1970s were in epistemology where john l pollock john pollock s 1974 knowledge and justification popularized his terminology of undercutting and rebutting which mirrored the analysis of toulmin pollock s work was significant precisely because it brought defeasibility so close to philosophical logicians the failure of logicians to dismiss defeasibility in epistemology as cambridge s logicians had done to hart decades earlier landed defeasible reasoning in the philosophical mainstream defeasibility had always been closely related to argument rhetoric and law except in epistemology where the chains of reasons and the origin of reasons were not often discussed nicholas rescher s dialectics is an example of how difficult it was for philosophers to contemplate more complex systems of defeasible reasoning this was in part because proponents of informal logic became the keepers of argument and rhetoric while insisting that formalism was anathema to argument about this time researchers in artificial intelligence became interested in non monotonic reasoning and its semantics with philosophers such as pollock and donald nute e g defeasible logic dozens of computer scientists and logicians produced complex systems of defeasible reasoning between 1980 and 2000 no single system of defeasible reasoning would emerge in the same way that quine s system of logic became a de facto standard nevertheless the 100 year headstart on non demonstrative logical calculi due to george boole charles sanders peirce and gottlob frege was being closed both demonstrative and non demonstrative reasoning now have formal calculi there are related and slightly competing systems of reasoning that are newer than systems of defeasible reasoning e g belief revision and dynamic logic modal logic dynamic logic the dialogue logics of charles leonard hamblin charles hamblin and jim mackenzie and their colleagues can also be tied closely to defeasible reasoning belief revision is a non constructive specification of the desiderata with which or constraints according to which epistemic change takes place dynamic logic is related mainly because like paraconsistent logic the reordering of premises can change the set of justified conclusions dialogue logics introduce an adversary but are like belief revision theories in their adherence to deductively consistent states of belief political and judicial use many political philosophers have been fond of the word indefeasible when referring to rights e g that were inalienable divine or indubitable for example in the 1776 virginia declaration of rights community hath an indubitable inalienable and indefeasible right to reform alter or abolish government also attributed to james madison and john adams the people have a right an indisputable unalienable indefeasible divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge i mean of the character and conduct of their rulers also lord aberdeen indefeasible right inherent in the british crown and gouverneur morris the basis of our own constitution is the indefeasible right of the people scholarship about abraham lincoln often cites these passages in the justification of secession philosophers who use the word defeasible have historically had different world views from those who use the word indefeasible and this distinction has often been mirrored by oxford and cambridge zeitgeist hence it is rare to find authors who use both words in judicial opinions the use of defeasible is commonplace there is however disagreement among legal logicians whether defeasible reasoning is central e g in the consideration of open texture precedent wikt exception exceptions and rationales or whether it applies only to explicit defeasance clauses h l a hart in the concept of law gives two famous examples of defeasibility no vehicles in the park except during parades and offer acceptance and memorandum produce a contract except when the contract is illegal the parties are minors inebriated or incapacitated etc specificity one of the main disputes among those who produce systems of defeasible reasoning is the status of a rule of specificity in its simplest form it is the same rule as subclass inheritance computer science inheritance preempting class inheritance r1 if r then defeasibly q e g if bird then can fly r2 if p then defeasibly not q e g if penguin then cannot fly o1 if p then deductively r e g if penguin then bird m1 arguably p e g arguably penguin m2 r2 is a more specific reason than r1 e g r2 is better than r1 m3 therefore arguably not q e g therefore arguably not flies approximately half of the systems of defeasible reasoning discussed today adopt a rule of specificity while half expect that such preference rules be written explicitly by whoever provides the defeasible reasons for example rescher s dialectical system uses specificity as do early systems of multiple inheritance e g david touretzky and the early argument systems of donald nute and of guillermo simari and ronald loui defeasible reasoning accounts of precedent stare decisis and case based reasoning also make use of specificity e g joseph raz and the work of kevin d ashley and edwina rissland meanwhile the argument systems of henry prakken and giovanni sartor of bart verheij and jaap hage and the system of phan minh dung do not adopt such a rule nature of defeasibility there is a distinct difference between those who theorize about defeasible reasoning as if it were a system of confirmational revision with affinities to belief revision and those who theorize about defeasibility as if it were the result of further non empirical investigation there are at least three kinds of further non empirical investigation progress in a lexical syntactic process progress in a computational process and progress in an adversary or legal proceeding defeasibility as corrigibility here a person learns something new that annuls a prior inference in this case defeasible reasoning provides a constructive mechanism for belief revision like a truth maintenance system as envisioned by jon doyle defeasibility as shorthand for preconditions here the author of a set of rules or legislative code is writing rules with exceptions sometimes a set of defeasible rules can be rewritten with more cogency with explicit local pre conditions instead of non local competing rules many non monotonic systems with fixed point mathematics fixed point or preferential semantics fit this view however sometimes the rules govern a process of argument the last view on this list so that they cannot be re compiled into a set of deductive rules lest they lose their force in situations with incomplete knowledge or incomplete derivation of preconditions defeasibility as an anytime algorithm here it is assumed that calculating arguments takes time and at any given time based on a subset of the potentially constructible arguments a conclusion is defeasibly justified isaac levi has protested against this kind of defeasibility but it is well suited to the heuristic projects of for example herbert a simon on this view the best move so far in a chess playing program s analysis at a particular depth is a defeasibly justified conclusion this interpretation works with either the prior or the next semantical view defeasibility as a means of controlling an investigative or social process here justification is the result of the right kind of procedure e g a fair and efficient hearing and defeasible reasoning provides impetus for pro and con responses to each other defeasibility has to do with the alternation of verdict as locutions are made and cases presented not the changing of a mind with respect to new empirical discovery under this view

b'the event calculus is a logic al language for representing and reasoning about events and their effects first presented by robert kowalski and marek sergot in 1986 it was extended by murray shanahan and rob miller computer scientist rob miller in the 1990s similar to other languages for reasoning about change the event calculus represents the effects of action artificial intelligence action s on fluent artificial intelligence fluent s however event computing event s can also be external to the system in the event calculus one can specify the value of fluents at some given time points the events that take place at given time points and their effects fluents and events in the event calculus fluents are reification knowledge representation reified this means that they are not formalized by means of predicate mathematics predicate s but by means of function mathematics function s a separate predicate math holdsat math is used to tell which fluents hold at a given time point for example math holdsat on box table t math means that the box is on the table at time math t math in this formula math holdsat math is a predicate while math on math is a function events are also represented as terms the effects of events are given using the predicates math initiates math and math terminates math in particular math initiates e f t math means that if the event represented by the term math e math is executed at time math t math then the fluent math f math will be true after math t math the math terminates math predicate has a similar meaning with the only difference being that math f math will be false and not true after math t math domain independent axioms like other languages for representing actions the event calculus formalizes the correct evolution of the fluent via formulae telling the value of each fluent after an arbitrary action has been performed the event calculus solves the frame problem in a way that is similar to the successor state axiom s of the situation calculus a fluent is true at time math t math if and only if it has been made true in the past and has not been made false in the meantime math holdsat f t leftarrow happens e t 1 wedge initiates e f t 1 wedge t 1 t wedge neg clipped t 1 f t math this formula means that the fluent represented by the term math f math is true at time math t math if an event math e math has taken place math happens e t 1 math this took place in the past math t 1 t math this event has the fluent math f math as an effect math initiates e f t 1 math the fluent has not been made false in the meantime math clipped t 1 f t math a similar formula is used to formalize the opposite case in which a fluent is false at a given time other formulae are also needed for correctly formalizing fluents before they have been effects of an event these formulae are similar to the above but math happens e t 1 wedge initiates e f t 1 math is replaced by math holdsat f t 1 math the math clipped math predicate stating that a fluent has been made false during an interval can be axiomatized or simply taken as a shorthand as follows math clipped t 1 f t 2 equiv exists e t happens e t wedge t 1 leq t t 2 wedge terminates e f t math domain dependent axioms the axioms above relate the value of the predicates math holdsat math math initiates math and math terminates math but do not specify which fluents are known to be true and which events actually make fluents true or false this is done by using a set of domain dependent axioms the known values of fluents are stated as simple literals math holdsat f t math the effects of events are stated by formulae relating the effects of events with their preconditions for example if the event math open math makes the fluent math isopen math true but only if math haskey math is currently true the corresponding formula in the event calculus is math initiates e f t equiv e open wedge f isopen wedge holdsat haskey t vee cdots math the right hand expression of this equivalence is composed of a disjunction for each event and fluent that can be made true by the event there is a disjunct saying that math e math is actually that event that math f math is actually that fluent and that the precondition of the event is met the formula above specifies the truth value of math initiates e f t math for every possible event and fluent as a result all effects of all events have to be combined in a single formulae this is a problem because the addition of a new event requires modifying an existing formula rather than adding new ones this problem can be solved by the application of circumscription logic circumscription to a set of formulae each specifying one effect of one event math initiates open isopen t leftarrow holdsat haskey t math math initiates break isopen t leftarrow holdsat hashammer t math math initiates break broken t leftarrow holdsat hashammer t math these formulae are simpler than the formula above because each effect of each event can be specified separately the single formula telling which events math e math and fluents math f math make math initiates e f t math true has been replaced by a set of smaller formulae each one telling the effect of an event on a fluent however these formulae are not equivalent to the formula above indeed they only specify sufficient conditions for math initiates e f t math to be true which should be completed by the fact that math initiates math is false in all other cases this fact can be formalized by simply circumscribing the predicate math initiates math in the formula above it is important to note that this circumscription is done only on the formulae specifying math initiates math and not on the domain independent axioms the predicate math terminates math can be specified in the same way math initiates math is a similar approach can be taken for the math happens math predicate the evaluation of this predicate can be enforced by formulae specifying not only when it is true and when it is false math happens e t equiv e open wedge t 0 vee e exit wedge t 1 vee cdots math circumscription can simplify this specification as only necessary conditions can be specified math happens open 0 math math happens exit 1 math circumscribing the predicate math happens math this predicate will be false at all points in which it is not explicitly specified to be true this circumscription has to be done separately from the circumscription of the other formulae in other words if math f math is the set of formulae of the kind math initiates e f t leftarrow cdots math math g math is the set of formulae math happens e t math and math h math are the domain independent axioms the correct formulation of the domain is math circ f initiates terminates wedge circ g happens wedge h math the event calculus as a logic program the event calculus was originally formulated as a set of horn clauses augmented with negation as failure and could be run as a prolog program in fact circumscription is one of the several semantics that can be given to negation as failure and is closely related to the completion semantics in which if is interpreted as if and only if mdash

journal of business research vol 49 no 1 july 2000 pp 57 65 ref it is widely used by service firms most often in conjunction with other measures of service quality and customer satisfaction the servqual instrument was developed as part of a broader conceptualisation of how customers understand service quality this conceptualisation is known as the model of service quality or more popularly as the gaps model the model of service quality the model of service quality popularly known as the gaps model was developed by a group of american authors a parasuraman valarie zeithaml valarie a

quality but after testing and retesting some of the dimensions were found to be autocorrelated and the total number of dimensions was reduced to five namely reliability assurance tangibles empathy and

ref parasuraman a berry l l zeithaml v a understanding customer expectations of service sloan management review vol 32 no 3 1991 p 39 ref the model s developers began with an exhaustive literature search in order to identify items that were believed to impact on perceived service quality this initial search identified some 100 items which were used in the first rounds of consumer testing prelimiary data analysis using a data reduction technique known as factor analysis also known as principal components analysis revealed that these items loaded onto ten dimensions or components of service quality the initial ten dimensions that were believed to represent service quality were competence human resources competence is the possession of the required skills and knowledge to perform the service for example there may be competence in the knowledge and skill of contact personnel knowledge and skill of operational support personnel and research capabilities of the organization courtesy is the consideration for the customer s property and a clean and neat appearance of contact personnel manifesting as politeness respect and friendliness credibility includes factors such as trustworthiness belief and honesty it involves having the customer s best interests at prime position it may be influenced by company name company reputation and the personal characteristics of the contact personnel security enables the customer to feel free from danger risk or doubt including physical safety financial security and confidentiality access is approachability and ease of contact for example convenient office operation hours and locations communication means both informing customers in a language they are able to understand and also listening to customers a company may need to adjust its language for the varying needs of its customers information might include for example explanation of the service and its cost the relationship between services and costs and assurances as to the way any problems are effectively managed knowing the customer means making an effort to understand the customer s individual needs providing individualized attention recognizing the customer when they arrive and so on this in turn helps to delight the customers by rising above their expectations tangibles are the physical evidence of the service for instance the appearance of the physical facilities tools and equipment used to provide the service the appearance of personnel and communication materials and the presence of other customers in the service facility reliability is the ability to perform the promised service in a dependable and accurate manner the service is performed correctly on the first occasion the accounting is correct records are up to date and schedules are kept responsiveness is the readiness and willingness of employees to help customers by providing prompt timely services for example mailing a transaction slip immediately or setting up appointments quickly further testing suggested that some of the ten preliminary dimensions of service quality were closely related or autocorrelated thus the ten initial dimensions were reduced and the labels amended to accurately reflect the revised dimensions by the early 1990s the authors had refined the model to five factors which in testing appear to be relatively stable and robust reliability the ability to perform the promised service dependably and accurately assurance the knowledge and courtesy of employees and their ability to convey trust and confidence tangibles the appearance of physical facilities equipment personnel and communication materials empathy the provision of caring individualized attention to customers responsiveness the willingness to help customers and to provide prompt service these are the five dimensions of service quality that form the basis of the individual items in the servqual research instrument questionnaire the acronym rater is often used to

storage options take into account websites publications email among other types of digital output create produce digital material and attach all relevant metadata typically the more metadata the more accessible the information access and use determine the level of accessibility for the range of digital material created some material may be accessible only by password and other material may be freely accessible to the public appraise and select consult the mission statement of the institution or private collection and determine what digital data is relevant there may also be legal guidelines in place that will guide the decision process for a particular collection dispose discard any digital material that is not deemed necessary to the institution ingest send digital material to the predetermined storage solution this may be an archive repository or other facility preservation action employ measures to maintain the integrity of the digital material reappraise reevaluate material to ensure that is it still relevant and is true to its original form store secure data within the predetermined storage facility access and reuse routinely check that material is still accessible for the intended audience and that the material has not been compromised through multiple uses transform if desirable or necessary the material may be transferred into a different digital format sheer curation sheer curation is an approach to digital curation where curation activities are quietly integrated into the normal work flow of those creating and managing data and other digital assets the word sheer is used to emphasize the lightweight and virtually transparent nature of these curation activities the term sheer curation was coined by alistair miles in the imagestore project ref http imageweb zoo ox ac uk wiki index php the imagestore project the imagestore project imageweb bot generated title ref and the uk digital curation centre s scarp project ref http www dcc ac uk

neuroimaging group the international journal of digital curation issue 1 volume 3 2008 ref sheer curation depends on the hypothesis that good data and digital asset management at the point of creation and primary use is also good practice in preparation for sharing publication and or long term preservation of these assets therefore sheer curation attempts to identify and promote tools and good practices in local data and digital asset management in specific domains where those tools and practices add immediate value to the creators and primary users of those assets curation can best be supported by identifying existing practices of sharing stewardship and re use that add value and augmenting them in ways that both have short term benefits and in the longer term reduce risks to digital assets or provide new opportunities to sustain their long term accessibility and re use value the aim of sheer curation is to establish a solid foundation for other curation activities which may not directly benefit the creators and primary users of digital assets especially those required to ensure long term preservation by providing this foundation further curation activities may be carried out by specialists at appropriate institutional and organisation levels whilst causing the minimum of interference to others a similar idea is curation at source used in the context of laboratory information management systems laboratory information management system lims this refers more specifically to automatic recording of metadata or information about data at the point of capture and has been developed to apply semantic web techniques to integrate laboratory instrumentation and documentation systems ref frey j http www allhands org uk 2008 programme jeremyfrey cfm

semantic frame as mary bought a car from john just from a different perspective a semantic frame can be thought of as a conceptual structure describing an event relation or object and the participants in it the framenet lexical database contains over 1 200 semantic frames 13 000 lexical units a pairing of a word with a meaning linguistics meaning polysemy polysemous words are represented by several lexical units and 202 000 example sentences framenet is largely the creation of charles j fillmore who developed the theory of frame semantics that the project is based on and was initially the

sentences and frame to frame relations frame elements frame elements fe provide additional information to the semantic structure of a sentence each frame has a number of core and non core fes which

that frame elements play in the example sentences for an example sentence like she was born about ad 460 framenet would mark she as a noun phrase referring to the tt child tt fe and about ad 460 as a noun phrase corresponding to the tt time tt frame element details of how frame elements can be realized in a sentence are important because this reveals important information about the subcategorization frame s as well as possible diathesis alternation s e g john broke the window vs the window broke of a verb lexical units lexical units lu are lemmas with their part of speech that evoke a specific frame in other words when a lu is identified in a sentence that specific lu can be associated with its specific frame s for each frame there are many lus associated to one frame and many frames that share multiple lus this is typically the case with lus that have multiple word senses ref https framenet icsi berkeley edu fndrupal glossary ref alongside the frame each lexical unit is associated with specific frame elements by means of the annotated example sentences example lexical units that evoke the tt complaining tt frame or more specific perspectivized versions of it to be precise include the verbs complain grouse lament and others ref https framenet2 icsi berkeley edu fnreports data frameindex xml frame complaining ref example sentences frames are associated with example sentences and frame elements are marked within the sentences thus the sentence she was born about ad 460 is associated with the frame tt being born tt while she is marked as the frame element tt child tt and about ad 460 is marked as tt time tt see the http framenet icsi berkeley edu fnreports displayreport php anno 9791 framenet annotation report for tt born v tt from the start the framenet project has been committed to looking at evidence from actual language use as found in text collections like the british national corpus based on such example sentences automatic semantic role labeling tools are able to determine frames and mark frame elements in new sentences valences framenet also exposes the statistics on the valences of the frames that is the number and the position of the frame elements within example sentences the sentence she was born about ad 460 falls in the valence pattern np ext ini np dep which occurs two times in the https framenet2 icsi berkeley edu fnreports data lu lu9791 xml example sentences in framenet namely in she was born about ad 460 daughter and granddaughter of roman and byzantine emperors whose family had been prominent in roman politics for over 700 years he was soon posted to north africa and never met their only child a daughter born 8 june 1941 frame relations framenet additionally captures relationships between different frames using relations these include the following inheritance when one frame is a more specific version of another more abstract parent frame anything that is true about the parent frame must also be true about the child frame and a mapping is specified between the frame elements of the parent and the frame elements of the child perspectivized in a neutral frame like tt commerce transfer goods tt is connected to a frame with a specific perspective of the same scenario e g the tt commerce sell tt frame which assumes the perspective of the seller or the tt commerce buy tt frame which assumes the perspective of the buyer subframe some frames like the tt criminal process tt frame refer to complex scenarios that consist of several individual states or events that can be described by separate frames like tt arrest tt tt trial tt and so on precedes the precedes relation captures a temporal order that holds between subframes of a complex scenario causative of and inchoative of there is a fairly systematic relationship between stative descriptions e g the tt position on a scale tt frame she had a high salary and causative descriptions tt cause change of scalar position tt she raised his salary or inchoative descriptions tt change position on a scale tt e g her salary increased using a relationship that holds between a frame that in some way involves another frame for instance the tt judgment communication tt frame uses both the tt judgment tt frame and the tt statement tt frame but does not inherit from either of them because there is no clear correspondence of the frame elements see also connects frames that bear some resemblance but need to be distinguished carefully applications framenet has proven useful in a number of computational applications because computers need additional knowledge in order to recognize that john sold a car to mary and mary bought a car from john describe essentially the same situation despite using two

b'user modeling is the subdivision of human computer interaction which describes the process of building up and modifying a conceptual understanding of the user the main goal of user modeling is customization and adaptation computer science adaptation of systems to the user s specific needs the system needs to say the right thing at the right time in the right way ref name fischer citation last1 fischer first1 gerhard title user modeling in human computer interaction journal user modeling and user adapted interaction 11 pages 65 68 year 2001 ref to do so it needs an internal representation of the user another common purpose is modeling specific kinds of users including modeling of their skills and declarative knowledge for use in automatic software tests ref name johnsontaatgen citation last1 johnson first1 addie last2 taatgen first2 niels chapter user modeling title handbook of human factors in web design pages 424 439 publisher lawrence erlbaum associates year 2005 ref user models can thus serve as a cheaper alternative to user testing background a user model is the collection and categorization of personal data associated with a specific user therefore it is the basis for any adaptive changes to the system s behavior which data is included in the model depends on the purpose of the application it can include personal information such as users names and ages their interests their skills and knowledge their goals and plans their preferences and their dislikes or data about their behavior and their interactions with the system there are different design patterns for user models though often a mixture of them is used ref name johnsontaatgen ref citation last1 hothi first1 jatinder last2 hall first2 wendy title an evaluation of adapted hypermedia techniques using static user modelling journal proceedings of the 2nd workshop on adaptive hypertext and hypermedia place southampton university electronics and computer science university road southampton hampshire uk year june 1998 url http wwwis win tue nl ah98 hothi hothi html ref static user models static user models are the most basic kinds of user models once the main data is gathered they are normally not changed again they are static shifts in users preferences are not registered and no learning algorithms are used to alter the model dynamic user models dynamic user models allow a more up to date representation of users changes in their interests their learning progress or interactions with the system are noticed and influence the user models the models can thus be updated and take the current needs and goals of the users into account stereotype based user models stereotype based user models are based on demographics demographic statistics based on the gathered information users are classification in machine learning classified into common stereotypes the system then adapts to this stereotype the application therefore can make assumptions about a user even though there might be no data about that specific area because demographic studies have shown that other users in this stereotype have the same characteristics thus stereotype based user models mainly rely on statistics and do not take into account that personal attributes might not match the stereotype however they allow predictions about a user even if there is rather little information about him or her highly adaptive user models highly adaptive user models try to represent one particular user and therefore allow a very high adaptivity of the system in contrast to stereotype based user models they do not rely on demographic statistics but aim to find a specific solution for each user although users can take great benefit from this high adaptivity this kind of model needs to gather a lot of information first data gathering information about users can be gathered in several ways there are three main methods asking for specific facts while first interacting with the system ref name johnsontaatgen mostly this kind of data gathering is linked with the registration process while registering users are asked for specific facts their likes and dislikes and their needs often the given answers can be altered afterwards learning users preferences by observing and interpreting their interactions with the system ref name johnsontaatgen in this case users are not asked directly for their personal data and preferences but this information is derived from their behavior while interacting with the system the ways they choose to accomplish a tasks the combination of things they takes interest in these observations allow inferences about a specific user the application dynamically learns from observing these interactions different machine learning algorithms may be used to accomplish this task a hybrid approach which asks for explicit feedback and alters the user model by adaptive learning ref name montaner citation last montaner first miguel last2 l\xc3\xb3pez first2 beatriz last3 de la rosa first3 josep llu\xc3\xads title a taxonomy of recommender agents on the internet journal artif intell rev volume 19 pages 285 330 year 2003 ref this approach is a mixture of the ones above users have to answer specific questions and give explicit feedback furthermore their interactions with the system are observed and the derived information are used to automatically adjust the user models though the first method is a good way to quickly collect main data it lacks the ability to automatically adapt to shifts in users interests it depends on the users readiness to give information and it is unlikely that they are going to edit their answers once the registration process is finished therefore there is a high likelihood that the user models are not up to date however this first method allows the users to have full control over the collected data about them it is in their decision which information they are willing to provide this possibility is missing in the second method adaptive changes in a system that learns users preferences and needs only by interpreting their behavior might appear a bit opaque to the users because they cannot fully understand and reconstruct why the system behaves the way it does ref name montaner moreover the system is forced to collect a certain amount of data before it is able to predict the users needs with the required accuracy therefore it takes a certain learning time before a user can benefit from adaptive changes however afterwards these automatically adjusted user models allow a quite accurate adaptivity of the system the hybrid approach tries to combine the advantages of both methods through collecting data by directly asking its users it gathers a first stock of information which can be used for adaptive changes by learning from the users interactions it can adjust the user models and reach more accuracy yet the designer of the system has to decide which of these information should have which amount of influence and what to do with learned data that contradicts some of the information given by a user system adaptation once a system has gathered information about a user it can evaluate that data by preset analytical algorithm and then start to adapt to the user s needs these adaptations may concern every aspect of the system s behavior and depend on the system s purpose information and functions can be presented according to the user s interests knowledge or goals by displaying only relevant features hiding information the user does not need making proposals what to do next and so on one has to distinguish between adaptation computer science adaptivity and adaptability adaptive and adaptable systems ref name fischer in an adaptable system the user can manually change the system s appearance behavior or functionality by actively selecting the corresponding options afterwards the system will stick to these choices in an adaptive system a dynamic adaption to the user is automatically performed by the system itself based on the built user model thus an adaptive system needs ways to interpret information about the user in order to make these adaptations one way to accomplish this task is implementing rule based filtering in this case a set of if then rules is established that covers the knowledge base of the system ref name johnsontaatgen the if conditions can check for specific user information and if they match the then branch is performed which is responsible for the adaptive changes another approach is based on collaborative filtering ref name johnsontaatgen ref name montaner in this case information about a user is compared to that of other users of the same systems thus if characteristics of the current user match those of another the system can make assumptions about the current user by presuming that he or she is likely to have similar characteristics in areas where the model of the current user is lacking data based on these assumption the system then can perform adaptive changes usages adaptive hypermedia in an adaptive hypermedia system the displayed content and the offered hyperlinks are chosen on basis of users specific characteristics taking their goals interests knowledge and abilities into account thus an adaptive hypermedia system aims to reduce the lost in hyperspace syndrome by presenting only relevant information adaptive educational hypermedia being a subdivision of adaptive hypermedia the main focus of adaptive educational hypermedia lies on education displaying content and hyperlinks corresponding to the user s knowledge on the field of study intelligent tutoring system unlike adaptive educational hypermedia systems intelligent tutoring systems are stand alone systems their aim is to help students in a specific field of study to do so they build up a user model where they store information about abilities knowledge and needs of the user the system can now adapt to this user by presenting appropriate exercises and examples and offering hints and help where the user is most likely to need them expert systems expert systems are computer systems that emulate the decision making ability of a human expert in order to help the user solving a problem in a specific area step by step they ask questions to identify the current problem and to find a solution user models can be used to adapt to the current user s knowledge differentiating between experts and novices the system can assume that experienced users are able to understand and answer more complex questions than someone who is new to the topic therefore it can adjust the used vocabulary and the type of question which are presented to the user thus reducing the steps needed to find a solution recommender system the basic idea of recommender systems is to present a selection of items to the user which best fit his or her needs this selection can be based on items the user has bookmarked rated bought recently viewed etc recommender systems are often used in e commerce but may also cover areas like social networks websites news etc usability testing user simulation since user modeling allows the system to hold an internal representation of a specific user different types of users can be simulated by artificially modeling them common types are experts or novices on the scope of the system or the usage of the system based on these characteristics user tests can be simulated standards a certain number of representation formats and standards are available for

b'multiple issues more footnotes date february 2011 essay like date october 2010 in information science an upper ontology also known as a top level ontology or foundation ontology is an ontology computer science ontology in the sense used in information science which consists of very general terms such as object property relation that are common across all domains an important function of an upper ontology is to support broad semantic interoperability among a large number of domain specific ontologies by providing a common starting point for the formulation of definitions terms in the domain ontology are ranked under the terms in the upper ontology and the former stand to the latter in subclass relations a number of upper ontologies have been proposed each with its own proponents each upper ontology can be considered as a computational implementation of natural philosophy which itself is a more empirical method for investigating the topics within the philosophical discipline of physical ontology library classification systems predate upper ontology systems though library classifications organize and categorize knowledge using general concepts that are the same across all knowledge domains neither system is a replacement for the other development any standard foundational ontology is likely to be contested among different groups each with their own idea of what exists one factor exacerbating the failure to arrive at a common approach has been the lack of open source applications that would permit the testing of different ontologies in the same computational environment the differences have thus been debated largely on theoretical grounds or are merely the result of personal preferences foundational ontologies can however be compared on the basis of adoption for the purposes of supporting interoperability across domain ontologies no particular upper ontology has yet gained widespread acceptance as a de facto standard different organizations have attempted to available ontologies define standards for specific domains the process specification language psl created by the national institute for standards and technology nist is one example another important factor leading to the absence of wide adoption of any existing upper ontology is the complexity some upper ontologies cyc is often cited as an example in this regard are very large ranging up to thousands of elements classes relations with complex interactions among them and with a complexity similar to that of a human natural language and the learning process can be even longer than for a natural language because of the unfamiliar format and logical rules the motivation to overcome this learning barrier is largely absent because of the paucity of publicly accessible examples of use as a result those building domain ontologies for local applications tend to create the simplest possible domain specific ontology not related to any upper ontology such domain ontologies may function adequately for the local purpose but they are very time consuming to relate accurately to other domain ontologies to solve this problem some genuinely top level ontologies have been developed which are deliberately designed to have minimal overlap with any domain ontologies examples are basic formal ontology and the domain ontology for linguistic and cognitive engineering dolce see below arguments for the infeasibility of an upper ontology unreferenced section date december 2016 historically many attempts in many societies which date december 2016 have been made to impose or define a single set of concepts as more primal basic foundational authoritative true or rational than all others a common objection by whom date december 2016 to such attempts points out that humans lack the sort of transcendent perspective or god s eye view that would be required to achieve this goal humans are bound by language or culture and so lack the sort of objective perspective from which to observe the whole terrain of concepts and derive any one standard another objection is the problem of formulating definitions top level ontologies are designed to maximize support for interoperability across a large number of terms such ontologies must therefore consist of terms expressing very general concepts but such concepts are so basic to our understanding that there is no way in which they can be defined since the very process of definition implies that a less basic and less well understood concept is defined in terms of concepts that are more basic and so ideally more well understood very general concepts can often only be elucidated for example by means of examples or paraphrase there is no self evident way of dividing the world up into concept s and certainly no non controversial one there is no neutral ground that can serve as a means of translating between specialized or lower or application specific ontologies human language itself is already an arbitrary approximation of just one among many possible conceptual maps to draw any necessary correlation between english language english words and any number of intellectual concepts we might like to represent in our ontologies is just asking for trouble wordnet for instance is successful and useful precisely because it does not pretend to be a general purpose upper ontology rather it is a tool for semantic syntactic linguistic disambiguation which is richly embedded in the particulars and peculiarities of the english language any hierarchical or topological representation of concepts must begin from some ontological epistemology epistemological linguistic cultural and ultimately pragmatic perspective such pragmatism does not allow for the exclusion of politics between persons or groups indeed it requires they be considered as perhaps more basic primitives than any that are represented those who date december 2016 who doubt the feasibility of general purpose ontologies are more inclined to ask what specific purpose do we have in mind for this conceptual map of entities and what practical difference will this ontology make this pragmatic philosophical position surrenders all hope of devising the encoded ontology version of everything that is the case wittgenstein tractatus logico philosophicus finally there are objections similar to those against artificial intelligence from whom date december 2016 technically the complex concept acquisition and the social linguistic interactions of human beings suggests any axiomatic foundation of most basic concepts must be cognitive biological or otherwise difficult to characterize since we don t have axioms for such systems ethically any general purpose ontology could quickly become an actual tyranny by recruiting adherents into a political program designed to propagate it and its funding means and possibly defend it by violence historically inconsistent and irrational belief systems have proven capable of commanding obedience to the detriment or harm of persons both inside and outside a society that accepts them how much more harmful would a consistent rational one be were it to contain even one or two basic assumptions incompatible with human life arguments for the feasibility of an upper ontology unreferenced section date november 2014 many of those who doubt the possibility of developing wide agreement on a common upper ontology fall into one of two traps they assert that there is no possibility of universal agreement on any conceptual scheme but they argue that a practical common ontology does not need to have universal agreement it only needs a large enough user community as is the case for human languages to make it profitable for developers to use it as a means to general interoperability and for third party developer to develop utilities to make it easier to use and they point out that developers of data schemes find different representations congenial for their local purposes but they do not demonstrate that these different representation are in fact logically inconsistent in fact different representations of assertions about the real world though not philosophical models if they accurately reflect the world must be logically consistent even if they focus on different aspects of the same physical object or phenomenon if any two assertions about the real world are logically inconsistent one or both must be wrong and that is a topic for experimental investigation not for ontological representation in practice representations of the real world are created as and known to be approximations to the basic reality and their use is circumscribed by the limits of error of measurements in any given practical application ontologies are entirely capable of representing approximations and are also capable of representing situations in which different approximations have different utility objections based on the different ways people perceive things attack a simplistic impoverished view of ontology the objection that there are logically incompatible models of the world are true but in an upper ontology those different models can be represented as different theories and the adherents of those theories can use them in preference to other theories while preserving the logical consistency of the necessary assumptions of the upper ontology the necessary assumptions provide the logical vocabulary with which to specify the meanings of all of the incompatible models it has never been demonstrated that incompatible models cannot be properly specified with a common more basic set of concepts while there are examples of incompatible theories that can be logically specified with only a few basic concepts many of the objections to upper ontology refer to the problems of life critical decisions or non axiomatized problem areas such as law or medicine or politics that are difficult even for humans to understand some of these objections do not apply to physical objects or standard abstractions that are defined into existence by human beings and closely controlled by them for mutual good such as standards for electrical power system connections or the signals used in traffic lights no single general metaphysics is required to agree that some such standards are desirable for instance while time and space can be represented many ways some of these are already used in interoperable artifacts like maps or schedules objections to the feasibility of a common upper ontology also do not take into account the possibility of forging agreement on an ontology that contains all of the primitive ontology elements that can be combined to create any number of more specialized concept representations adopting this tactic permits effort to be focused on agreement only on a limited number of ontology elements by agreeing on the meanings of that inventory of basic concepts it becomes possible to create and then accurately and automatically interpret an infinite number of concept representations as combinations of the basic ontology elements any domain ontology or database that uses the elements of such an upper ontology to specify the meanings of its terms will be automatically and accurately interoperable with other ontologies that use the upper ontology even though they may each separately define a large number of domain elements not defined in other ontologies in such a case proper interpretation will require that the logical descriptions of domain specific elements be transmitted along with any data that is communicated the data will then be automatically interpretable because the domain element descriptions based on the upper ontology will be properly interpretable by any system that can properly use the upper ontology in effect elements in different domain ontologies can be translated into each other using the common upper ontology an upper ontology based on such a set of primitive elements can include alternative views provided that they are logically compatible logically incompatible models can be represented as alternative theories or represented in a specialized extension to the upper ontology the proper use of alternative theories is a piece of knowledge that can itself be represented in an ontology users that develop new domain ontologies and find that there are semantic primitives needed for their domain but missing from the existing common upper ontology can add those new primitives by the accepted procedure expanding the common upper ontology as necessary most proponents who date april 2015 of an upper ontology argue that several good ones may be created with perhaps different emphasis very few are actually arguing to discover just one within natural language or even an academic field most are simply standardizing some existing communication another view advanced is that there is almost total overlap of the different ways that upper ontologies have been formalized in the sense that different ontologies focus on a different aspect of the same entities but the different views are complementary and not contradictory to each other as a result an internally consistent ontology that contains all the views with means of translating the different views into the other is feasible such an ontology has not thus far been constructed however because it would require a large project to develop so as to include all of the alternative views in the separately developed upper ontologies along with their translations the main barrier to construction of such an ontology is not the technical issues but the reluctance of funding agencies to provide the funds for a large enough consortium of developers and users several common arguments against upper ontology can be examined more clearly by separating issues of concept definition ontology language lexicons and facts knowledge for instance people have different terms and phrases for the same concept however that does not necessarily mean that those people are referring to different concepts they may simply be using different language or idiom formal ontologies typically use linguistic labels to refer to concepts but the terms that label ontology elements mean no more and no less than what their axioms say they mean labels are similar to variable names in software evocative rather than definitive the proponents of a common upper ontology point out that the meanings of the elements classes relations rules in an ontology depend only on their logical form and not on the labels which are usually chosen merely to make the ontologies more easily usable by their human developers in fact the labels for elements in an ontology need not be words they could be for example images of instances of a particular type or videos of an action that is represented by a particular type it cannot be emphasized too strongly that words are not what are represented in an ontology but entities in the real world or abstract entities concepts in the minds of people words are not equivalent to ontology elements but words label ontology elements there can be many words that label a single concept even in a single language synonymy and there can be many concepts labeled by a single word ambiguity creating the mappings between human language and the elements of an ontology is the province of natural language understanding but the ontology itself stands independently as a logical and computational structure for this reason finding agreement on the structure of an ontology is actually easier than developing a controlled vocabulary because all different interpretations of a word can be included each mapped to the same word in the different terminologies a second argument is that people believe different things and therefore can t have the same ontology however people can assign different truth values to a particular assertion while accepting the validity of certain underlying claims facts or way of expressing an argument with which they disagree using for instance the issue position argument form this objection to upper ontologies ignores the fact that a single ontology can represent different belief systems representing them as different belief systems without taking a position on the validity of either even arguments about the existence of a thing require a certain sharing of a concept even though its existence in the real world may be disputed separating belief from naming and definition also helps to clarify this issue and show how concepts can be held in common even in the face of differing belief for instance wiki as a medium may permit such confusion but disciplined users can apply dispute resolution methods to sort out their conflicts it is also argued that most people share a common set of semantic primitives fundamental concepts to which they refer when they are trying to explain unfamiliar terms to other people an ontology that includes representations of those semantic primitives could in such a case be used to create logical descriptions of any term that a person may wish to define logically that ontology would be one form of upper ontology serving as a logical interlingua that can translate ideas in one terminology to its logical equivalence logical equivalent in another terminology advocates who date april 2015 argue that most disagreement about the viability of an upper ontology can be traced to the conflation of ontology language and knowledge or too specialized areas of knowledge many people or agents or groups will have areas of their respective internal ontologies that do not overlap if they can cooperate and share a conceptual map at all this may be so very useful that it outweighs any disadvantages that accrue from sharing to the degree it becomes harder to share concepts the deeper one probes the more valuable such sharing tends to get if the problem is as basic as opponents of upper ontologies claim then it also applies to a group of humans trying to cooperate who might need machine assistance to communicate easily if nothing else such ontologies are implied by machine translation used when people cannot practically communicate whether upper or not these seem likely to proliferate available upper ontologies basic formal ontology bfo main basic formal ontology the basic formal ontology bfo framework developed by barry smith academic and ontologist barry smith and his associates consists of a series of sub ontologies at different levels of granularity the ontologies are divided into two varieties relating to continuant entities such as three dimensional enduring objects and occurrent entities primarily processes conceived as unfolding in successive phases through time bfo thus incorporates both three dimensionalist and four dimensionalist perspectives on reality within a single framework interrelations are defined between the two types of ontologies in a way which gives bfo the facility to deal with both static spatial and dynamic temporal features of reality a continuant domain ontology descending from bfo can be conceived as an inventory of entities existing at a time each occurrent ontology can be conceived as an inventory of processes unfolding through a given interval of time both bfo itself and each of its extension sub ontologies can be conceived as a window on a certain portion of reality at a given level of granularity more than http ifomis uni saarland de bfo users 200 extension ontologies of bfo have been

initiated as a project of the cosmo working group of the ontology and taxonomy coordinating working group with the goal of developing a foundation ontology that can serve to enable broad general semantic interoperability the current version is an owl ontology but a common logic compliant version is anticipated in the future the ontology and explanatory files are available at the cosmo site the goal of the cosmo working group was to develop a foundation ontology by a collaborative process that will allow it to represent all of the basic ontology elements that all members feel are needed for their applications the development of cosmo is fully open and any comments or suggestions from any sources are welcome after some discussion and input from members in 2006 the development of the cosmo has been continued primarily by patrick cassidy the chairman of the cosmo working group contributions and suggestions from any interested party are still welcome and encouraged many of the types owl classes in the current cosmo have been taken from the opencyc owl version 0 78 and from the sumo other elements were taken from other ontologies such as bfo and dolce or developed specifically for cosmo development of the cosmo initially focused on including representations of all of the words in the longman dictionary of contemporary english ldoce controlled defining vocabulary 2148 words these words are sufficient to define linguistically all of the entries in the ldoce it is hypothesized that the ontological representations of the concepts represented by those terms will be sufficient to specify the meanings of any specialized ontology element thereby serving as a basis for general semantic interoperability interoperability via cosmo is enabled by using the cosmo or an ontology derived from it as an interlingua by which other domain ontologies can be translated into each other s terms and thereby accurately communicate as new domains are linked into cosmo additional

it is small there are 140 classes and 127 properties it is comprehensive most enterprises will not find the need to create additional primitive classes but will find that most of their classes can be defined and derived from gist it is robust all the classes descend from 12 primitive classes which are mostly mutually disjoint this aids a great deal in subsequent error detection there are 1342

reduce ambiguity it is understandable in addition to being built on concrete generally understood primitives it is extremely modular the 140 classes are implemented in 18 modular ontologies each can

b'globalize date july 2010 in the social sciences framing comprises a set of concepts and theoretical perspectives on how individuals groups and societies organize perceive and communicate about reality framing involves social construction of a social phenomenon by mass media sources political or social movements political leaders or other actors and organizations participation in a language community necessarily influences an individual s perception of the meanings attributed to words or phrases politically the language communities of advertising religion and mass media are highly contested whereas framing in less sharply defended speech community language communities might evolve imperceptibly and organically over cultural time frames with fewer overt modes of disputation framing itself can be framed in one of two ways depending on whether one chooses to emphasise processes of cognition thought or processes of interpersonal communication frames in thought consist of the mental representations interpretations and simplifications of reality frames in communication consist of the communication of frames between different actors ref name druckman2001 cite journal last1 druckman first1 j n year 2001 title the implications of framing effects for citizen competence url journal political behavior volume 23 issue 3 pages 225 256 doi 10 1023 a 1015006907312 ref one can view framing in communication as positive or negative depending on the audience and what kind of information is being presented framing might also be understood as being either equivalence frames which represent logically equivalent alternatives portrayed in different ways see framing effect psychology framing effect or as emphasis frames which simplify reality by focusing on a subset of relevant aspects of a situation or issue ref name druckman2001 in the case of equivalence frames the information being presented is based on the same facts but the frame in which it is presented changes thus creating a reference dependent perception the effects of framing can be seen in many journalism applications with the same information being used as a base the frame surrounding the issue can change the reader s perception without having to alter the actual facts in the context of politics or mass media communication a frame defines the packaging of an element of rhetoric in such a way as to encourage certain interpretations and to discourage others for political purposes framing often presents facts in such a way that implicates a problem that is in need of a solution members of political parties attempt to frame issues in a way that makes a solution favoring their own political leaning appear as the most appropriate course of action for the situation at hand ref name van der

ma harvard university press ref in other words people build a series of mental filters through biological and cultural influences they then use these filters to make sense of the world the choices they then make are influenced by their creation of a frame framing is also a key component of sociology the study of social interaction among humans framing is an integral part of conveying and processing data on a daily basis successful framing techniques can be used to reduce the ambiguity of intangible topics by contextualizing the information in such a way that recipients can connect to what they already know explanation when one seeks to explain an event the understanding often depends on the frame referred to if a friend rapidly closes and opens an eye we will respond very differently depending on whether we attribute this to a purely physical frame they blinked or to a social frame they winked though the former might result from a speck of dust resulting in an involuntary and not particularly meaningful reaction the latter would imply a voluntary and meaningful action to convey humor to an accomplice for example observers will read events seen as purely physical or within a frame of nature differently from those seen as occurring with social frames but we do not look at an event and then apply a frame to it rather individuals constantly project into the world around them the interpretive frames that allow them to make sense of it we only shift frames or realize that we have habitually applied a frame when incongruity calls for a frame shift in other words we only become aware of the frames that we always already use when something forces us to replace one frame with another ref this example borrowed from clifford geertz local knowledge

university press 1986 isbn 0 930350 91 x page 39 in each case the mirror represents more than simply a physical object ref framing is so effective because it is a heuristic or mental shortcut that may not always yield desired results and is seen as a rule of thumb according to susan t fiske and shelley e taylor human beings are by nature cognitive misers meaning they prefer to do as little thinking as possible ref fiske s t taylor s e 1991 social cognition 2nd ed new york mcgraw hill ref frames provide people a quick and easy way to process information hence people will use the previously mentioned mental filters a series of which is called a schema to make sense of incoming messages this gives the sender and framer of the information enormous power to use these schemas to influence how the receivers will interpret the message ref name entmanroberttree entman robert tree beard framing toward clarification of a fractured paradigm journal of communication autumn 1993 43 4 p 51 ref though some consider framing to be synonymous with agenda setting theory agenda setting other scholars state that there is a distinction according to an article written by donald h weaver framing

norms political actors and cultural situations it assumes that several media frames compete to set one frame regarding an issue and one frame finally gains influence because it resonates with popular culture fits with media practices or is heavily sponsored by elite s first in terms of practices of news production there are at least five aspects of news work that may influence how journalists frame a certain issue larger societal norms and values organizational pressures and constraints external pressures from interest group s and other policy maker s professional routines and ideological or political orientations of journalists the second potential influence on frame building comes from elites including interest groups government bureaucracies and other political or corporate actors empirical studies show that these influences of elites seem to be strongest for issues in which journalists and various players in the policy arena can find shared narratives finally cultural contexts of a society are also able to establish frame goffman ref name goffman1974 assumes that the meaning of a frame has implicit cultural roots this context dependency of media frame has been described as

are significantly more likely to do so when they have existing schema for those constructs this is called the applicability effect that is when new frames invite people to apply their existing schema to an issue the implication of that application depends in part on what is in that schema therefore generally the more the audiences know about issues the more effective are frames there are a number of levels and types of framing effects that have been examined for example scholars have focused on attitudinal and behavioral changes the degrees of perceived importance of the issue voting decisions and opinion formations others are interested in psychological processes other than applicability for instance iyengar ref iyengar s 1991 is anyone responsible how television frames political issues

justifications for war in a terrorist age lanham md rowman and littlefield 2006 ref jim a kuypers examined the differences in framing of the war on terror between the bush administration and the u s mainstream news between 2001 and 2005 kuypers looked for common themes between presidential speeches and press reporting of those speeches and then determined how the president and the press had framed those themes by using a rhetorical version of framing analysis kuypers determined that the u s news media advanced frames counter to those used by the bush administration quote the press actively contested the framing of the war on terror as early as eight weeks following 9 11 this finding stands apart from a collection of communication literature suggesting the press supported the president or was insufficiently critical of the president s efforts after 9 11 to the contrary when taking into consideration how themes are framed kuypers found that the news media framed its response in such a way that it could be viewed as supporting the idea of some action against terrorism while concommitantly opposing the initiatives of the president the news media may well relay what the president says but it does not necessarily follow that it is framed in the same manner thus an echo of the theme but not of the frame the present study demonstrates as seen in table one below that shortly after 9 11 the news media was beginning to actively counter the bush administration and beginning to leave out information important to understanding the bush administration s conception of the war on terror in sum eight weeks after 9 11 the news media was moving beyond reporting political opposition to the president a very necessary and invaluable press function and was instead actively

through a rhetorical frame it is argued that without the frame the facts of an argument become lost on an audience making the argument less effective the rhetoric of politics uses framing to present the facts surrounding an issue in a way that creates the appearance of a problem at hand that requires a solution politicians using framing to make their own solution to an exigence appear to be the most appropriate compared to that of the opposition ref name van der pas counter arguments become less effective in persuading an audience once one side has framed an argument because it is argued that the opposition then has the additional burden of arguing the frame of the issue in addition to the issue itself framing a political issue a political party or a political opponent is a strategy

b'other uses reification disambiguation reification is the process by which an abstract idea about a computer program is turned into an explicit data model or other object created in a programming language a computable addressable object a resource is created in a system as a proxy for a non computable addressable object by means of reification something that was previously implicit unexpressed and possibly inexpressible is explicitly formulated and made available to conceptual logical or computational manipulation informally reification is often referred to as making something a first class citizen within the scope of a particular system some aspect of a system can be reified at language design time which is related to reflection computer science reflection in programming languages it can be applied as a stepwise refinement at system design time reification is one of the most frequently used techniques of conceptual analysis and knowledge representation reification and reflective programming languages in the context of programming language s reification is the process by which a user program or any aspect of a programming language that was implicit in the translated program and the run time system are expressed in the language itself this process makes it available to the program which can inspect all these aspects as ordinary data in reflection computer science reflective languages reification data is causally connected to the related reified aspect such that a modification to one of them affects the other therefore the reification data is always a faithful representation of the related reified aspect reification data is often said to be made a first class object reification at least partially has been experienced in many languages to date in early lisp programming language lisp dialects and in current prolog prolog dialects programs have been treated as data although the causal connection has often been left to the responsibility of the programmer

the abstract data type s used in a formal specification data reification is the terminology of the vienna development method vdm that most other people would call data refinement an example is taking a step towards an implementation by replacing a data representation without a counterpart in the intended implementation language such as sets by one that does have a counterpart such as maps with fixed domains that can be implemented by arrays or at least one that is closer to having a counterpart such as sequences the vdm community prefers the word reification over refinement as the process

any other entity it must be an instance of an entity type in the present example the entity type has been named code membership code for each instance of code ismemberof code there is one and only one instance of code membership code and vice versa now it becomes possible to add more information to the original relationship as an example we can express the fact that person p1 was nominated to be

reification on semantic web rdf and owl in semantic web languages such as resource description framework rdf and web ontology language owl a statement is a binary relation it is used to link two individuals or an individual and a value applications sometimes need to describe other rdf statements for instance to record information like when statements were made or who made them which is sometimes called provenance information as an example we may want to represent properties of a relation such as our certainty about it severity or strength of a relation relevance of a relation and so

committee membership12345 committee incommittee committee c1 person p2 committee nominated committee membership12345 source additionally rdf provides a built in vocabulary intended for describing rdf

accessdate 2010 10 09 ref using the reification vocabulary a reification of the statement about the person s membership would be given by assigning the statement a uriref such as code committee

committee membership12345stat rdf predicate committee ismemberof committee membership12345stat rdf object committee c1 source these statements say that the resource identified by the code uriref committee membership12345stat code is an rdf statement that the subject of the statement refers to the resource identified by code person p1 code the predicate of the statement refers to the resource identified by code committee ismemberof code and the object of the statement refers to the resource code committee c1 code assuming that the original statement is actually identified by code committee membership12345 code it should be clear by comparing the original statement with the reification that the reification actually does describe it the conventional use of the rdf reification vocabulary always involves describing a statement using four statements in this pattern therefore they are sometimes referred to as the reification quad ref name rdf using reification according to this convention we could record the fact that code person p3 code added the statement to the database by source lang sparql person p3 committee addedtodatabase committee membership12345stat source it is important to note that in the conventional use of reification the subject of the reification triples is assumed to identify a particular instance of a triple in a particular rdf document rather than some arbitrary triple having the same subject predicate and object this particular convention is used because reification is intended for expressing properties such as dates of composition and source information as in the examples given already and these properties need to be applied to specific instances of triples note that the described triple code subject predicate object code itself is not implied by such a reification quad and it is not necessary that it actually exists in the database this allows also to use this mechanism to express which triples do not hold the power of the reification vocabulary in rdf is restricted by the lack of a built in means for assigning urirefs to statements so in order to express provenance information of this kind in rdf one has to use some mechanism outside of rdf to assign uris to individual rdf statements then make further statements about those individual statements using their uris to identify them ref name rdf reification in topic maps in an topic maps xml topic map xtm only a topic can have a name or play a role in an association one may use an association to make an assertion about a topic but one cannot directly make assertions about that assertion however it is possible to create a topic that reifies a non topic construct in a map thus enabling the association to be named and treated as a topic itself ref http www techquila com practical intro html practical introduction into topic maps ref reification and n ary relations in semantic web languages such as rdf and owl a property is a binary relation used to link two individuals or an individual and a value however in some cases the natural and convenient way to represent certain concepts is to use relations to link an individual to more than just one individual or value these relations are called n ary relations examples are representing relations among multiple individuals such as a committee a person who is a committee member and another person who has nominated the first person to become the committee member or a buyer a seller and an object that was bought when describing a purchase of a book a more general approach to reification is to create an explicit new class and n new properties to represent an n ary relation making an instance of the relation linking the n individuals an instance of this class this approach can also be used

different perceptions of the domain based on cultural background education ideology etc at present merging ontologies that are not developed from a common foundation ontology is a largely manual

tech rep ai tr 419 dep of electrical engineering and computer science of mit 1978 ref is a knowledge representation approach to efficient handling of inferred information that is explicitly stored reason maintenance distinguishes between base facts which can be defeasible reasoning defeated and derived facts as such it differs from belief revision which in its basic form assumes that all facts are equally important reason maintenance was originally developed as a technique for implementing problem solvers ref name originaltr it encompasses a variety of techniques that share a common architecture ref name mcallesterinterface mcallester d a truth maintenance aaai90 1990 ref two components a reasoner and a reason maintenance system communicate with each other via an interface the reasoner uses the reason maintenance system to record its inferences and justifications of reasons for the inferences the reasoner also informs the reason maintenance system which are the currently valid base facts assumptions the reason maintenance system uses the information to compute the truth value of the stored derived facts and to restore consistency if an inconsistency is derived a truth maintenance system or tms is a knowledge representation method for representing both beliefs and their dependencies and an algorithm called the truth maintenance algorithm that manipulates and maintains the dependencies the name truth maintenance is due to the ability of these systems to restore consistency it is also termed as a belief revision system a truth maintenance system maintains consistency between old believed knowledge and current believed knowledge in the knowledge base kb through revision if the current believed statements contradict the knowledge in the kb then the kb is updated with the new knowledge it may happen that the same data will again come into existence and the previous knowledge will be required in the kb if the previous data is not present it is required for new inference but if the previous knowledge was in the kb then no retracing of the same knowledge was needed hence the use of tms to avoid such retracing it keeps track of the contradictory data with the help of a dependency record this record reflects the retractions and additions which makes the inference engine ie aware of its current belief set each statement having at least one valid justification is made a part of the current belief set when a contradiction is found the statement s responsible for the contradiction are identified and an appropriate is retraced this process is called dependency directed backtracking the tms algorithm maintains the records in the form of a dependency network the nodes in the network are one of the entries in the kb a premise antecedent or inference rule etc each arc of the network represent the inference steps from which the node was derived a premise is a fundamental belief which is assumed to be always true they do not need justifications considering premises are base from which justifications for all other nodes will be stated there are two types of justification for each node they are support list sl conditional proof cp many kinds of truth maintenance systems exist two major types are single context and multi context truth maintenance in single context systems consistency is maintained among all facts in memory database and relates to the notion of consistency found in classical logic multi context systems support paraconsistency by allowing consistency to be relevant to a subset of facts in memory a context according to the history of logical inference this is achieved by tagging each fact or deduction with its logical history multi agent truth maintenance systems perform truth maintenance across multiple memories often located on different machines de kleer s assumption based truth maintenance system atms 1986 was utilized in systems based upon ai winter the fall of expert systems kee on the

jacobs the cognitive map likely exists on a circuit involving much more than just the hippocampus even if it is primarily based there other than the medial entorhinal cortex the presubiculum and parietal cortex have also been implicated in the generation of cognitive maps ref name moser parallel map theory there has been some evidence for the idea that the cognitive map is represented in the hippocampus by two separate maps the first is the bearing map which represents the environment through self movement cues and gradient cues the use of these vector mathematics vector based cues creates a rough 2d map of the environment the second map would be the sketch map that works off of positional cues the second map integrates specific objects or landmark s and their relative locations to create a 2d map of the environment the cognitive map is thus obtained by the integration of these two separate maps ref name jacobs generation the cognitive map is generated from a number of sources both from the visual system and elsewhere much of the cognitive map is created through self generated movement sensory cue cues inputs from senses like vision proprioception olfaction and hearing are all used to deduce a person s location within their environment as they move through it this allows for path integration the creation of a vector that represents one s position and direction within one s environment specifically in comparison to an earlier reference point this resulting vector can be passed along to the hippocampal place cells where it is interpreted to provide more information about the environment and one s location within the context of the cognitive map ref name jacobs cite journal last1 jacobs first1 lucia f last2 schenk first2 fran\xc3\xa7oise date

ref directional cues and positional landmarks are also used to create the cognitive map within directional cues both explicit cues like markings on a compass as well as gradients like shading or magnetic fields are used as inputs to create the cognitive map directional cues can be used both statically when a person does not move within his environment while interpreting it and dynamically when movement through a gradient is used to provide information about the nature of the surrounding environment positional landmarks provide information about the environment by comparing the relative position of specific objects whereas directional cues give information about the shape of the environment itself these landmarks are processed by the hippocampus together to provide a graph of the environment through relative locations ref name jacobs history the idea of a cognitive map was first developed by edward c tolman tolman one of the early cognitive psychologists introduced this idea when doing an experiment involving rats and mazes in tolman s experiment a rat was placed in a cross shaped maze and allowed to explore it after this initial exploration the rat was placed at one arm of the cross and food was placed at the next arm to the immediate right the rat was conditioned to this layout and learned to turn right at the intersection in order to get to the food when placed at different arms of the cross maze however the rat still went in the correct direction to obtain the food because of the initial cognitive map it had created of the maze rather than just deciding to turn right at the intersection no matter what the rat was able to determine the correct way to the food no matter where in the maze it was placed ref cite book last goldstein first e bruce date 2011

mind until an actual manifestation usually a drawing of this perceived knowledge is generated a mental map cognitive mapping is the implicit mental mapping the explicit part of the same process in most cases a cognitive map exists independently of a mental map an article covering just cognitive maps would remain limited to theoretical considerations in some uses mental map refers to a practice done by urban theorists by having city dwellers draw a map from memory of their city or the place they live this allows the theorist to get a sense of which parts of the city or dwelling are more

b'refimprove date january 2014 lumpers and splitters are opposing factions in any discipline that has to categorization place individual examples into rigorously defined categories the lumper splitter problem occurs when there is the need to create classifications and assign examples to them for example schools of literature biology biological taxon taxa and so on a lumper is an individual who takes a wikt gestalt gestalt view of a definition and assigns examples broadly assuming that differences are not as important as signature similarities a splitter is an individual who takes precise definitions and creates new categories to classify samples that differ in key ways origin of the terms the earliest use of these terms was by charles darwin in a letter to j d hooker in 1857 those who make many species are the splitters and those who make few are the lumpers they were introduced more widely by george g simpson in his 1945 work the principles of classification and a classification of mammals as he put it splitters make very small units their critics say that if they can tell two animals apart they place them in different genera \xe2\x80\xa6 and if they cannot tell them apart they place them in different species \xe2\x80\xa6 lumpers make large units their critics say that if a carnivora carnivore is neither a dog nor a bear they call it a cat ref cite journal last simpson

hill plucked quotations from sources in a way that distorted their meaning hexter explained this as a mental habit that he called lumping according to him lumpers rejected differences and chose to emphasize similarities any evidence that did not fit their arguments was ignored as aberrant splitters by contrast emphasised differences and resisted simple schemes while lumpers consistently tried to create coherent patterns splitters preferred incoherent complexity ref cite journal last chase first bob title upstart antichrist journal history workshop journal issue 60 date autumn 2005 pages 202 206 ref usage in various fields biology anchor lumping and splitting in biology main biological classification the categorization and naming of a particular species should be regarded as a hypothesis about the evolution ary relationships and distinguishability of that group of organisms as further information comes to hand the hypothesis may be confirmed or refuted sometimes especially in the past when communication was more difficult taxonomists working in isolation have given two distinct names to individual organism s later identified as the same species when two named species are agreed to be of the same species the older species name is almost always retained dropping the newer species name honoring a convention known as priority of nomenclature this form of lumping is technically called synonymization dividing a taxon into multiple often new taxa is called splitting taxonomists are often referred to as lumpers or splitters by their colleagues depending on their personal approach to recognizing differences or commonalities between organisms history main periodization in history lumpers are those who tend to create broad definitions that cover large periods of time and many disciplines whereas splitters want to assign names to tight groups of inter relationships lumping tends to create a more and more unwieldy definition with members having less and less mutually in common this can lead to definitions which are little more than conventionalities or groups which join fundamentally different examples splitting often leads to distinction without a difference distinctions without difference ornate and fussy categories and failure to see underlying similarities for example in the arts romanticism romantic can refer specifically to a period of germany german poetry roughly from 1780 1810 but would exclude the later work of goethe among other writers in music it can mean every composer from johann nepomuk hummel hummel through sergei rachmaninoff rachmaninoff plus many that came after software modelling software engineering often proceeds by building models sometimes known as model driven architecture a lumper is keen to generalize and produces models with a small number of broadly defined objects a splitter is reluctant to generalize and produces models with a large number of narrowly defined objects conversion between the two styles is not necessarily symmetrical for example if error messages in two narrowly defined classes behave in the same way the classes can be easily combined but if some messages in a broad class behave differently every object in the class must be examined before the class can be split this illustrates the principle that splits can be lumped more easily than lumps can be split ref

way to settle the question splitters regard the comparative method linguistics comparative method meaning not comparison in general but only reconstruction of a common ancestor or protolanguage as the only valid proof of kinship and consider genetic linguistics genetic relatedness to be the question of interest american linguists of recent decades tend to be splitters lumpers are more willing to admit techniques like mass lexical comparison or lexicostatistics and mass typological comparison and to tolerate the uncertainty of whether relationships found by these methods are the result of linguistic divergence descent from common ancestor or language convergence borrowing much long range comparison work has been from russian linguists like vladislav illich svitych and sergei starostin

semantic information is included this means that the model describes the meaning of its instances such a semantic data model is an abstraction that defines how the stored symbol s the instance data relate to the real world ref name fips184 it is a conceptual data model that includes the capability to express information that enables parties to the information exchange to interpret meaning semantics from the instances without the need to know the meta model such semantic models are fact oriented as opposed to object oriented facts are typically expressed by binary relations between data elements whereas higher order relations are expressed as collections of binary relations typically binary relations have the form of triples object relationtype object for example the eiffel tower is located in paris typically the instance data of semantic data models explicitly include the kinds of relationships between the various data elements such as is located in to interpret the meaning of the facts from the instances it is required that the meaning of the kinds of relations relation types be known therefore semantic data models typically standardise such relation types this means that the second kind of semantic data models enable that the instances express facts that include their own meaning the second kind of semantic data models are usually meant to create semantic databases the ability to include meaning in semantic databases facilitates building distributed database s that enable applications to interpret the meaning from the content this implies that semantic databases can be integrated when they use the same standard relation types this also implies that in general they have a wider applicability than relational or object oriented databases overview the logical data structure of a database management system dbms whether hierarchical model hierarchical network model network or relational model relational cannot totally satisfy the requirements analysis requirements for a conceptual definition of data because it is limited in scope and biased toward the implementation strategy employed by the dbms therefore the need to define data from a three schema approach conceptual view has led to the development of semantic data modeling techniques that is techniques to define the meaning of data within the context of its interrelationships with other data as illustrated in the figure the real world in terms of resources ideas events etc are symbolically defined within physical data stores a semantic data model is an abstraction which defines how the stored symbols relate to the real world thus the model must be a true representation of the real world ref name fips184 according to klas and schrefl 1995 the overall goal of semantic data models is to capture more meaning of data by integrating relational concepts with more powerful abstraction concepts known from the artificial intelligence field the idea is to provide high level modeling

and then transformed into a physical database design for any of the various dbms technologies in addition to generating databases which are consistent and shareable development costs can be drastically reduced through data modeling evaluation of vendor software since a data model actually represents the infrastructure of an organization vendor software can be evaluated against a company

b'in artificial intelligence a procedural reasoning system prs is a framework for constructing real time reasoning system reasoning systems that can perform complex tasks in dynamic environments it is based on the notion of a rational agent or intelligent agent using the belief desire intention software model a user application is predominately defined and provided to a prs system is a set of knowledge areas each knowledge area is a piece of procedural knowledge that specifies how to do something e g how to navigate down a corridor or how to plan a path in contrast with robotic architectures where the computer programmer programmer just provides a model of what the states of the world are and how the agent s primitive actions affect them such a program together with a prs interpreter computing interpreter is used to control the agent the interpreter is responsible for maintaining beliefs about the world state choosing which goals to attempt to achieve next and choosing which knowledge area to apply in the current situation how exactly these operations are performed might depend on domain specific metaknowledge meta level knowledge areas unlike traditional computer planning ai planning systems that generate a complete plan at the beginning and replan if unexpected things happen prs interleaves planning and doing actions in the world at any point the system might only have a partially specified plan for the future prs is based on the bdi software agent bdi or belief desire intention framework for intelligent agents beliefs consist of what the agent believes to be true about the current state of the world desires consist of the agent s goals and intentions consist of the agent s current plans for achieving those goals furthermore each of these three components is typically explicitly represented somewhere within the memory of the prs agent at runtime which is in contrast to purely reactive systems such as the subsumption architecture history the prs concept was developed by the artificial intelligence center at sri international during the 1980s by many workers including michael georgeff amy l lansky and fran\xc3\xa7ois f\xc3\xa9lix ingrand their framework was responsible for exploiting and popularizing the bdi model in software for control of an intelligent agent the seminal application of the framework was a fault detection system for the reaction control system of the nasa space shuttle discovery development on this prs continued at the australian artificial intelligence institute through to the late 1990s which lead to the development of a c implementation and extension called distributed multi agent reasoning system dmars architecture image prs gif thumb depiction of the prs architecture the system architecture of sri s prs includes the following components database for beliefs about the world represented using first order predicate calculus goals to be realized by the system as conditions over an interval of time on internal and external state descriptions desires knowledge areas kas or plans that define sequences of low level actions toward achieving a goal in specific situations intentions that include those kas that have been selected for current and eventual execution interpreter or inference mechanism that manages the system features sri s prs was developed for embedded application in dynamic and real time environments as such it specifically addressed the limitations of other contemporary control and reasoning architectures like expert system s and the blackboard system the following define the

will continue to reduce the utilization of the internet the third issue is of privacy due to both spyware and security holes in operating systems there is concern that the transactions that consumers undertake have privacy limitations for example by stealthily following online activities firms can develop fairly accurate descriptions of customer profiles possibility of privacy violations will reduce the utilizations of the internet the final issue is that e service can also become intrusive as they reduce time and location barriers of other forms of contract for example firms can contact people through mobile devices at any time and at any place customers do not take like the intrusive behavior and may not use the e service platform heiner and lyer 2007 ref heiner and lyer 2007 e

aspects of e service and e service delivery one worth noting effort is rowley s study 2006 ref name autogenerated1 who did a review study on the e service literature the key finding of his study is that there is need to explore dimensions of e service delivery not focusing only on service quality in order to understand e service experiences it is necessary to go beyond studies of e service quality dimensions and to also take into account the inherent characteristics of e service delivery and the factors that differentiate one service experience from another some of the major keywords of

of the concerns associated with computer usage in any organization including governments is the health risk such as injuries related to working continuously on a computer keyboard government agencies are expected to work with regulatory groups in order to avoid these problems potential impacts on society despite some economic benefits of ict to individuals there is evidence that the computer literacy and access gap between the haves and have nots may be increasing education and information access are more than ever the keys to economic prosperity yet access by individuals in different countries is not equal this social inequity has become known as the digital divide impact on social interaction advancements in ict and e technology solutions have enabled many government functions to

agencies to collect store and make data available online to individuals and organizations citizens and businesses expect to be allowed to access data in a flexible manner at any time and from any

the simplicity of the system methodology being the resources only linked from country pages and thus lacking real integration this need was addressed by starting to integrate additional data such as

b'the fao geopolitical ontology is an ontology information science ontology developed by the fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao to describe manage and exchange data related to geopolitical entities such as countries territories regions and other similar areas definitions and examples an ontology information science ontology is a kind of dictionary that describes information in a certain domain using concepts and relationships it is often implemented using web ontology language owl web ontology language an xml based standard language that can be interpreted by computers a concept is defined as abstract knowledge for example in the geopolitical ontology a united nations list of non self governing territories non self governing territory or a geographical region geographical group are concepts concepts are explicitly implemented in the ontology with individuals and classes an individual is defined as an object perceived from the real world in the geopolitical domain ethiopia or the least developed countries group are individuals a class is defined as a set of individuals sharing common properties in the geopolitical domain ethiopia republic of korea or italy are individuals of the class self governing territory and least developed countries is an individual of the class special group relationships between concepts are explicitly implemented by object computer science object properties between individuals of two classes for example has member and is in group properties as shown in figure 1 datatype properties between individuals and literals or xml datatypes for example the individual afghanistan has the datatype property codeiso3 with the value afg restrictions in classes and or properties for example the property official

dereferenciation was implemented to allow for three different uris to be assigned to each resource as follows uri identifying the non information resource information resource with an rdf xml representation information resource with an html representation in addition the current uris used for owl format needed to be kept to allow for backwards compatibility for other systems that are using them therefore the new uris for the fao geopolitical ontology in lod were carefully created using cool uris for semantic web and considering other good practices for uris such as dbpedia uris new uris the uris of the geopolitical ontology need to be permanent consequently all transient information such as year version or format was avoided in the definition of the uris the new uris can be accessed

b'the iso 15926 is a standard for data integration sharing exchange and hand over between computer system s the title industrial automation systems and integration mdash integration of life cycle data for process plants including oil and gas production facilities is regarded too narrow by the present iso 15926 developers having developed a generic data model and reference data library for process plants it turned out that this subject is already so wide that actually any state information may be modelled with it history in 1991 a european union european strategic program on research in information technology esprit named processbase started the focus of this research project was to develop a data model for lifecycle information of a facility that would suit the requirements of the process industries at the time that the project duration had elapsed a consortium of companies involved in the process industries had been established epistle european process industries step technical liaison executive initially individual companies were members but later this changed into a situation where three national consortia were the only members pistep uk posc caesar norway and uspi nl netherlands later pistep merged into posc caesar and uspi nl was renamed to uspi epistle took over the work of the processbase project initially this work involved a standard called iso 10303 221 referred to as iso 10303 step ap221 in that ap221 we saw for the first time an annex m with a list of standard instances of the ap221 data model including types of objects these standard instances would be for reference and would act as a knowledge base with knowledge about the types of objects in the early nineties epistle started an activity to extend annex m to become a library of such object classes and their relationships steplib in the steplib activities a group of approx 100 domain experts from all three member consortia spread over the various expertises e g electrical piping rotating equipment etc worked together to define the core classes the development of steplib was extended with many additional classes and relationships between classes and published as open source data furthermore the concepts and relation types from the ap221 and iso 15926 2 data models were also added to the steplib dictionary this resulted in the development of gellish english whereas steplib became the gellish english dictionary gellish english is a structured subset of natural english and is a modeling language suitable for knowledge modeling product modeling and data exchange it differs from conventional modeling languages meta language s as used in information technology as it not only defines generic concepts but also includes an english dictionary the semantic expression capability of gellish english was significantly increased by extending the number of relation types that can be used to express knowledge and information for modelling technical reasons posc caesar proposed another standard than iso 10303 called iso 15926 epistle and iso supported that proposal and continued the modelling work thereby writing part 2 of iso 15926 this part 2 has official iso is international standard status since 2003 posc caesar started to put together their own rdl reference data library they added many specialized classes for example for american national standards institute ansi american national standards institute pipe and pipe fittings meanwhile steplib continued its existence mainly driven by some members of uspi since it was clear that it was not in the interest of the industry to have two libraries for in essence the same set of classes the management board of epistle decided that the core classes of the two libraries shall be merged into part 4 of iso 15926 this merging process has been finished part 4 should act as reference data for part 2 of iso 15926 as well as for iso 10303 221 and replaced its annex m on june 5 2007 iso 15926 4 was signed off as a ts technical specification in 1999 the work on an earlier version of part 7 started initially this was based on xml schema w3c xml schema the only useful w3c recommendation available then but when web ontology language web ontology language owl became available it was clear that provided a far more suitable environment for part 7 part 7 passed the first iso ballot by the end of 2005 and an

problems found in the soft systems method for information system design the main thrust of the research into has been to show how soft systems methodology ssm a method of systems analysis can be extended into artificial intelligence background ssm employs three modeling devices i e rich pictures root definitions and conceptual models of human activity systems the root definitions and conceptual models are built by stakeholders themselves in an iterative debate organized by a facilitator the strengths of this method lie firstly in its flexibility the fact that it can address any problem situation and secondly in the fact that the solution belongs to the people in the organization and is not imposed by an outside analyst ref name source gregory frank hutson and lau sui pong

categories which show the required information inputs and outputs from the activities identified in an expanded conceptual model and the maltese cross a matrix which shows the inputs and outputs from the information categories and shows where new information processing procedures are required a completed maltese cross is sufficient for the detailed design of a transaction processing system the

possible solutions at this stage it not assumed that a kbs will be a solution and logico linguistic modeling often produces solutions that do not require a computerized kbs expert systems tend to capture the expertise of individuals in different organizations on the same topic by contrast a kbs produced by logico linguistic modeling seeks to capture the expertise of individuals in the same

true indicated by the m modal operator before proceeding to stage 5 the models are expressed in logical formulae 5 computer code formulae in predicate logic translate easily into the prolog artificial intelligence language the modality is expressed by two different types of prolog rules rules taken from the language creation stage of model building process are treated as incorrigible while rules from the knowledge elicitation stage are marked as hypothetical rules the system is not confined to decision support but has a built in learning capability 6 verification a knowledge based system built using this method verifies itself verification and validation software verification takes place when the kbs is used by the clients it is an ongoing process that continues throughout the life of the system if the stakeholder beliefs about the real world are mistaken this will be brought out by the addition of prolog facts that conflict with the hypothetical rules it operates in accordance to

can be fully swept math m vec x left begin array 20 c mu sigma 1 sigma 1 end array right math except for normalization constant the above equation completely determines the normal density function for x therefore math m vec x math represents the probability distribution of x in the potential form these two simple matrices allow us to represent three special cases of linear belief functions first for an ordinary normal probability distribution m x represents it second suppose one makes a direct observation on x and obtains a value \xce\xbc in this case since there is no uncertainty both variance and covariance vanish i e \xcf\x83 0 thus a direct observation can be represented as math m x left begin array 20 c mu 0 end array right math third suppose one is completely ignorant about x this is a very thorny case in bayesian statistics since the density function does not exist by using the fully swept moment matrix we represent the vacuous linear belief functions as a zero matrix in the swept form follows math m vec x left begin array 20 c 0 0 end array right math one way to understand the representation is to imagine complete ignorance as the limiting case when the variance of x approaches to \xe2\x88\x9e where one can show that \xcf\x83 sup \xe2\x88\x921 sup 0 and hence math m vec x math vanishes however the above equation is not the same as an improper prior or normal distribution with infinite variance in fact it does not correspond to any unique probability distribution for this reason a better way is to understand the vacuous linear belief functions as the neutral element for combination see later to represent the remaining three special cases we need the concept of partial sweeping unlike a full sweeping a partial sweeping is a transformation on a subset of variables suppose x and y are two vectors of normal variables with the joint moment matrix math m x y left begin array 20 c begin array 20 c mu 1 sigma 11 sigma 21 end array begin array 20 c mu 2 sigma 12 sigma 22 end array end array right math then m x y may be partially swept for example we can define the partial sweeping on x as follows math m vec x y left begin array 20 c begin array 20 c mu 1 sigma 11 1 sigma 11 1 sigma 21 sigma 11 1 end array begin array 20 c mu 2 mu 1 sigma 11 1 sigma 12 sigma 11 1 sigma 12 sigma 22 sigma 21 sigma 11 1 sigma 12 end array end array right math if x is one dimensional a partial sweeping replaces the variance of x by its negative inverse and multiplies the inverse with other elements if x is multidimensional the operation involves the inverse of the covariance matrix of x and other multiplications a swept matrix obtained from a partial sweeping on a subset of variables can be equivalently obtained by a sequence of partial sweepings on each individual variable in the subset and the order of the sequence does not matter similarly a fully swept matrix is the result of partial sweepings on all variables we can make two observations first after the partial sweeping on nbsp x the mean vector and covariance matrix of x are respectively math mu 1 sigma 11 1 math and math sigma 11 1 math which are the same as that of a full sweeping of the marginal moment matrix of nbsp x thus the elements corresponding to x in the above partial sweeping equation represent the marginal distribution of x in potential form second according to statistics math mu 2 mu 1 sigma 11 1 sigma 12 math is the conditional mean of y given x nbsp nbsp 0 math sigma 22 sigma 21 sigma 11 1 sigma 12 math is the conditional covariance matrix of y given x nbsp nbsp 0 and math sigma 11 1 sigma 12 math is the slope of the regression model of y on nbsp x therefore the elements corresponding to y indices and the intersection of x and y in math m vec x y math represents the conditional distribution of y given nbsp x nbsp nbsp 0 these semantics render the partial sweeping operation a useful method for manipulating multivariate normal distributions they also form the basis of the moment matrix representations for the three remaining important cases of linear belief functions including proper belief functions linear equations and linear regression models proper linear belief functions for variables x and y assume there exists a piece of evidence justifying a normal distribution for variables y while bearing no opinions for variables nbsp x also assume that x and y are not perfectly linearly related i e their correlation is less than nbsp 1 this case involves a mix of an ordinary normal distribution for y and a vacuous belief function for nbsp x thus we represent it using a partially swept matrix as follows math m vec x y left begin array 20 c begin array 20 c 0 0 0 end array begin array 20 c mu 2 0 sigma 22 end array end array right math this is how we could understand the representation since we are ignorant on nbsp x we use its swept form and set math mu 1 sigma 11 1 0 math and math sigma 11 1 0 math since the correlation between x and y is less than nbsp 1 the regression coefficient of x on y approaches to 0 when the variance of x approaches to nbsp \xe2\x88\x9e therefore math sigma 11 1 sigma 12 0 math similarly one can prove that math mu 1 sigma 11 1 sigma 12 0 math and math sigma 21 sigma 11 1 sigma 12 0 math linear equations suppose x and y are two row vectors and y xa b where a and b are the coefficient matrices we represent the equation using a partially swept matrix as follows math m vec x y left begin array 20 c begin array 20 c 0 0 a t end array begin array 20 c b a 0 end array end array right math we can understand the representation based on the fact that a linear equation contains two pieces of knowledge 1 complete ignorance about all variables and 2 a degenerate conditional distribution of dependent variables given independent variables since x is an independent vector in the equation we are completely ignorant about it thus math mu 1 sigma 11 1 0 math and math sigma 11 1 0 math given x 0 y is completely determined to be b thus the conditional mean of y is b and the conditional variance is 0 also the regression coefficient matrix is a note that the knowledge to be represented in linear equations is very close to that in a proper linear belief functions except that the former assumes a perfect correlation between x and y while the latter does not this observation is interesting it characterizes the difference between partial ignorance and linear equations in one parameter correlation linear regression models a linear regression model is a more general and interesting case than previous ones suppose x and y are two vectors and y xa b e where a and b are the appropriate coefficient matrices and e is an independent white noise satisfying e n 0 \xcf\x83 we represent the model as the following partially swept matrix math m vec x y left begin array 20 c begin array 20 c 0 0 a t end array begin array 20 c b a sigma end array end array right math this linear regression model may be considered as the combination of two pieces of knowledge see later one is specified by the linear equation involving three variables x y and e and the other is a simple normal distribution of e i e e n 0 \xcf\x83 alternatively one may consider it similar to a linear equation except that given x 0 y is not completely determined to be b instead the conditional mean of y is b while the conditional variance is \xcf\x83 note that in this alternative interpretation a linear regression model forms a basic building block for knowledge representation and is encoded as one moment matrix besides the noise term e does not appear in the representation therefore it makes the representation more efficient from representing the six special cases we see a clear advantage of the moment matrix representation i e it allows a unified representation for seemingly diverse types of knowledge including linear equations joint and conditional distributions and ignorance the unification is significant not only for knowledge representation in artificial intelligence but also for statistical analysis and engineering computation for example the representation treats the typical logical and probabilistic components in statistics observations distributions improper priors for bayesian statistics and linear equation models not as separate concepts but as manifestations of a single concept it allows one to see the inner connections between these concepts or manifestations and to interplay them for computational purposes knowledge operations there are two basic operations for making inferences in expert system s using linear belief functions combination and marginalization combination corresponds to the integration of knowledge whereas marginalization corresponds to the coarsening of knowledge making an inference involves combining relevant knowledge into a full body of knowledge and then projecting the full body of knowledge to a partial domain in which an inference question is to be answered marginalization marginalization projects a linear belief function into one with fewer variables expressed as a moment matrix it is simply the restriction of a nonswept moment matrix to a submatrix corresponding to the remaining variables for example for the joint distribution m x y its marginal to y is math m downarrow y x y left begin array 20 c mu 2 sigma 22 end array right math when removing a variable it is important that the variable has not been swept on in the corresponding moment matrix i e it does not have an arrow sign above the variable for example projecting the matrix math m vec x y math to y produces math m downarrow y vec x y left begin array 20 c mu 2 mu 1 sigma 11 1 sigma 12 sigma 22 sigma 21 sigma 11 1 sigma 12 end array right math which is not the same linear belief function of y however it is easy to see that removing any or all variables in y from the partially swept matrix will still produce the correct result a matrix representing the same function for the remaining variables to remove a variable that has been already swept on we have to reverse the sweeping using partial or full reverse sweepings assume math m vec x math is a fully swept moment matrix math m vec x left begin array 20 c bar mu bar sigma end array right math then a full reverse sweeping of math m vec x math will recover the moment matrix m x as follows math m x left begin array 20 c bar mu bar sigma 1 bar sigma 1 end array right math if a moment matrix is in a partially swept form say math m vec x y left begin array 20 c begin array 20 c bar mu 1 bar sigma 11 bar sigma 21 end array begin array 20 c bar mu 2 bar sigma 12 bar sigma 22 end array end array right math its partially reverse sweeping on x is defined as follows math m x y left begin array 20 c begin array 20 c bar mu 1 bar sigma 11 1 bar sigma 11 1 bar sigma 21 bar sigma 11 1 end array begin array 20 c bar mu 2 bar mu 1 bar sigma 11 1 bar sigma 12 bar sigma 11 1 bar sigma 12 bar sigma 22 bar sigma 21 bar sigma 11 1 bar sigma 12 end array end array right math reverse sweepings are similar to those of forward ones except for a sign difference for some multiplications however forward and reverse sweepings are opposite operations it can be easily shown that applying the fully reverse sweeping to math m vec x math will recover the initial moment matrix m x it can also be proved that applying a partial reverse sweeping on x to the matrix math m vec x y math will recover the moment matrix m x y as a matter of fact liu ref l liu local computation of gaussian belief functions international journal of approximate reasoning vol 22 pp 217 248 1999 ref proves that a moment matrix will be recovered through a reverse sweeping after a forward sweeping on the same set of variables it can be also recovered through a forward sweeping after a reverse sweeping intuitively a partial forward sweeping factorizes a joint into a marginal and a conditional whereas a partial reverse sweeping multiplies them into a joint combination according to dempster s rule the combination of belief functions may be expressed as the intersection of focal elements and the multiplication of probability density functions liping liu applies the rule to linear belief functions in particular and obtains a formula of combination in terms of density functions later he proves a claim by arthur p dempster and reexpresses the formula as the sum of two fully swept matrices mathematically assume math m 1 vec x left begin array 20 c bar mu 1 bar sigma 1 end array right math and math m 2 vec x left begin array 20 c bar mu 2 bar sigma 2 end array right math are two lbfs for the same vector of variables x then their combination is a fully swept matrix math m vec x left begin array 20 c bar mu 1 bar mu 2 bar sigma 1 bar sigma 2 end array right math this above equation is often used for multiplying two normal distributions here we use it to define the combination of two linear belief functions which include normal distributions as a special case also note that a vacuous linear belief function 0 swept matrix is the neutral element for combination when applying the equation we need to consider two special cases first if two matrices to be combined have different dimensions then one or both matrices must be vacuously extended i e assuming ignorance on the variables that are no present in each matrix for example if m sub 1 sub x y and m sub 2 sub x z are to be combined we will first extend them into math m 1 x y vec z math and math m 2 x vec y z math respectively such that math m 1 x y vec z math is ignorant about z and math m 2 x vec y z math is ignorant about y the vacuous extension was initially proposed by kong ref a kong multivariate belief functions and graphical models in department of statistics cambridge ma harvard university 1986 ref for discrete belief functions second if a variable has zero variance it will not permit a sweeping operation in this case we can pretend the variance to be an extremely small number say \xce\xb5 and perform the desired sweeping and combination we can then apply a reverse sweeping to the combined matrix on the same variable and let \xce\xb5 approaches 0 since zero variance means complete certainty about a variable this \xce\xb5 procedure will vanish \xce\xb5 terms in the final result in general to combine two linear belief functions their moment matrices must be fully swept however one may combine a fully swept matrix with a partially swept one directly if the variables of the former matrix have been all swept on in the later we can use the linear regression model y xa b e to illustrate the property as we mentioned the regression model may be considered as the combination of two pieces of knowledge one is specified by the linear equation involving three variables x y and e and the other is a simple normal distribution of e i e e n 0 \xcf\x83 let math m 1 vec x vec rm e y left begin array 20 c 0 0 b 0 0 a 0 0 i a t i 0 end array right math and math m 2 vec rm e left begin array 20 c 0 sigma 1 end array right math be their moment matrices respectively then the two matrices can be combined directly without sweeping math m 1 vec x vec rm e y math on y first the result of the combination is a partially swept matrix as follows math m vec x vec rm e y left begin array 20 c 0 0 b 0 0 a 0 sigma 1 i a t i 0 end array right math if we apply a reverse sweeping on e and then remove e from the matrix we will obtain the same representation of the regression model applications we may use an audit problem to illustrate the three types of variables as follows suppose we want to audit the ending balance of accounts receivable e as we saw earlier e is equal to the beginning balance b plus the sales s for the period minus the cash receipts c on the sales plus a residual r that represents insignificant sales returns and cash discounts thus we can represent the logical relation as a linear equation math e b s c r math furthermore if the auditor believes e and b are 100 thousand dollars on the average with a standard deviation 5 and the covariance 15 we can represent the belief as a multivariate normal distribution if historical data indicate that the residual r is zero on the average with a standard deviation of 0 5 thousand dollars we can summarize the historical data by normal distribution r nbsp nbsp n 0 nbsp 0 5 sup 2 sup if there is a direct observation on cash receipts we can represent the evidence as an equation say c 50 thousand dollars if the auditor knows nothing about the beginning balance of accounts receivable we can represent his or her ignorance by a vacuous lbf finally if historical data suggests that given cash receipts nbsp c the sales s is on the average 8 c nbsp nbsp 4 and has a standard deviation 4 thousand dollars we can represent the knowledge as a linear regression model s nbsp nbsp n 4 nbsp nbsp 8 c nbsp 16

b'document classification or document categorization is a problem in library science information science and computer science the task is to assign a document to one or more class philosophy classes or categorization categories this may be done manually or intellectually or algorithmically the intellectual classification of documents has mostly been the province of library science while the algorithmic classification of documents is mainly in information science and computer science the problems are overlapping however and there is therefore interdisciplinary research on document classification the documents to be classified may be texts images music etc each kind of document possesses its special classification problems when not otherwise specified text classification is implied documents may be classified according to their subject documents subjects or according to other attributes such as document type author printing year etc in the rest of this article only subject classification is considered there are two main philosophies of subject classification of documents the content based approach and the request based approach content based versus request based classification content based classification is classification in which the weight given to particular subjects in a document determines the class to which the document is assigned it is for example a common rule for classification in libraries that at least 20 of the content of a book should be about the class to which the book is assigned ref library of congress 2008 the subject headings manual washington dc library of congress policy and standards division sheet h 180 assign headings only for topics that comprise at least 20 of the work ref in automatic classification it could be the number of times given words appears in a document request oriented classification or indexing is classification in which the anticipated request from users is influencing how documents are being classified the classifier asks himself under which descriptors should this entity be found and think of all the possible queries and decide for which ones the entity at hand is relevant soergel 1985 p nbsp 230 ref soergel dagobert 1985 organizing information principles of data base and retrieval systems orlando fl academic press ref request oriented classification may be classification that is targeted towards a particular audience or user group for example a library or a database for feminist studies may classify index documents differently when compared to a historical library it is probably better however to understand request oriented classification as policy based classification the classification is done according to some ideals and reflects the purpose of the library or database doing the classification in this way it is not necessarily a kind of classification or indexing based on user studies only if empirical data about use or users are applied should request oriented classification be regarded as a user based approach classification versus indexing sometimes a distinction is made between assigning documents to classes classification versus assigning subject documents subjects to documents subject indexing but as frederick wilfrid lancaster has argued this distinction is not fruitful these terminological distinctions he writes are quite meaningless and only serve to cause confusion lancaster 2003 p nbsp 21 ref lancaster f w 2003 indexing and abstracting in theory and practice library association london ref the view that this distinction is purely superficial is also supported by the fact that a classification system may be transformed into a thesaurus and vice versa cf aitchison 1986 ref aitchison j 1986 a classification as a source for

b'about knowledge management software the general concept personal knowledge management copypaste url http www cs colorado edu department publications reports docs cu cs 997 05 pdf date june 2016 a personal knowledge base pkb is an electronic tool used to express capture and later retrieve the personal knowledge of an individual it differs from a traditional database in that it contains subjective material particular to the owner that others may not agree with nor care about importantly a pkb consists primarily of knowledge rather than information in other words it is not a collection of documents or other sources an individual has encountered but rather an expression of the distilled knowledge the owner has extracted from those sources ref name davies 2005 ref name davies 2011 definition the term personal knowledge base was mentioned as early as the 1980s ref name brooks 1985 ref name kruger 1986 ref name forman 1988 ref name smith 1991 but the term came to prominence when it was described at length in publications by computer scientist stephen davies and colleagues ref name davies 2005 ref name davies 2011 who defined the term as follows efn an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the term personal knowledge base was coined in 2011 in fact stephen davies and colleagues wrote a paper on the subject in 2005 ref name davies 2005 and publications by other authors had mentioned the term as early as the 1980s ref name brooks 1985 ref name kruger 1986 ref name forman 1988 ref name smith 1991 much of the present article closely follows the publications by davies and colleagues personal a pkb is intended for private use and its contents are custom tailored to the individual it contains trends relationships categories and personal observations that its owner perceives but which no one else may agree with it can be shared just as one can explain one s own opinion to a hearer but it is not jointly owned by anyone else any more than explaining one s opinion to a friend causes the friend to own one s mind knowledge a pkb contains knowledge not merely information its purpose is not simply to aggregate all the information sources one has seen but to preserve the knowledge that one has learned from those sources when a user returns to a pkb to retrieve knowledge she has stored she is not merely pointed back to the original documents where she must relocate reread reparse and relearn the relevant passages instead she is returned to the distilled version of the particular truth she is seeking so that the mental model she originally had in mind can be easily reformed base a pkb is a consolidated integrated knowledge store it is a reflection of its owner s memory which as bush and many others have observed can freely associate any two thoughts together without restriction hence a pkb does not attempt to partition a user s field of knowledge into multiple segments that cannot reference one another rather it can connect any two concepts without regard for artificial boundaries and acts as a single unified whole contrast with other classes of systems the following classes of systems cannot be classified as pkbs ref name davies 2005 ref name davies 2011 collaborative efforts to build a universal objective space as opposed to an individual s personal knowledge the world wide web itself is in this category as were its predecessors hyperties ref name schneiderman 1987 and xanadu ref name nelson 1987 web categorization systems like the open directory project and collaborative information collections like wikipedia search systems like enfish and the stuff i ve seen project ref name dumais et al 2003 that index and search one s information sources on demand but do not give the user the ability to craft and express personal knowledge tools whose goal is to produce a design artifact rather than to maintain knowledge for its own sake systems like art ref name nakakoji et al 2000 and writing environment ref name smith et al 1987 use intermediate knowledge representations as a means to an end abandoning them once a final artifact has been produced and hence are not suitable as pkbs systems that focus on capturing transient information rather than archiving knowledge that has long term value examples would be web logs ref name godwin jones 2003 and e diaries ref name kovalainen et al 1998 tools whose information domain is mostly limited to time management tasks calendars action items contacts etc rather than general knowledge blandford and thomas r g green green ref name blandford and green 2001 and palen ref name palen 1999 give excellent surveys common commercial examples would be microsoft outlook ibm lotus notes lotus notes and evolution software novell evolution similarly tools developed for a specific domain such as bibliographic research rather than for general knowledge personal information management pkm is similar to personal information management but is a distinct topic based on the information vs knowledge difference pkbs are about recording and managing the knowledge one derives from documents whereas pim is more about managing and retrieving the documents themselves ref name davies 2005 ref name davies 2011 historical influences non electronic personal knowledge bases have probably existed in some form since the dawn of written language leonardo da vinci journals and notes da vinci s notebooks are a famous example more commonly card files and personal annotated libraries have served this function in the pre electronic age bush s memex undoubtedly the most famous early formulation of an electronic pkb was vannevar bush s description of the memex in 1945 ref name bush 1945 bush surveyed the post world war ii landscape and laid out what he viewed as the most important forthcoming challenges to humankind in the atlantic monthly the memex was a theoretical never implemented design or a system to help tackle the information overload problem already formidable in 1945 in bush s own words blockquote consider a future device for individual use which is a sort of mechanized private file and library a device in which an individual stores all his books records and communications and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility it is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory blockquote bush envisioned collaborative aspects as well and even a world wide system that scientists could freely consult citation needed date november 2012 but an important emphasis throughout the article was on expanding our own powers of recollection man needs to mechanize his record more fully he says if he is not to become bogged down by overtaxing his limited memory with the memex the user could add marginal notes and comments and build a trail of his interest through the larger information space she could share trails with friends identify related works and create personal annotations bush s memex would give each individual the ability to create categorize classify and relate his own set of information corresponding to his unique personal viewpoint much of that information would in fact consist of bits and pieces from public documents just as the majority of the knowledge inside our own heads has been imbibed from what we read and hear but the memex also allowed for the specialized recording of information that each individual perceived and needed to retain the idea of supplementing our memory was not a one size fits all proposition since no two people have the same interests opinions or memories instead it demanded a subjective expression of knowledge unique to each individual graphical knowledge capture tools great emphasis is placed on the pictorial nature of diagrams to represent abstract knowledge the use of spatial layout color and images is said to strengthen understanding and promote creativity each of the three primary schools mind map ping concept map ping and cognitive map ping prescribes its own data model and procedures and each boasts a number of software applications designed specifically to create compatible diagrams mind mapping mind map ping was promoted by pop psychologist tony buzan in the 1960s and commands the allegiance of an impressive number of adherents worldwide a mind map is essentially nothing more than a visual outline in which a main idea or topic is written in the center of the diagram and subtopics radiate outwards in increasing levels of specificity the primary value is in the freeform spatial layout rather than a sequential numbered outline the ability for a software application to hide or reveal select levels of detail and as mentioned above graphical adornments the basic data model is a tree graph theory tree rather than a graph discrete mathematics graph with all edges implicitly labeled supertopic subtopic numerous tools are available for constructing mind maps concept mapping concept map s were developed by cornell professor joseph d novak joseph novak ref name novak 2003 and based on david ausubel s assimilation theory of learning ref name ausubel 1968 an essential tenet is that newly encountered knowledge must be related to one s prior knowledge in order to be properly understood concept maps help depict such connections graphically like mind maps they feature evocative words or phrases in boxes connected by lines there are two principal differences however first a concept map is properly a graph not a tree permitting arbitrary links between nodes rather than only parent child relationships and second the links are labeled to identify the nature of the inter concept relationship typically with a verb phrase in this way the links on a diagram can be read as english sentences with the upstream node as the subject and the downstream node as the direct object of the sentence there are many applications available that could be used for drawing these diagrams not all of which directly acknowledge their support for concept maps in particular ref name canas et al 2005 ref name gaines and shaw 1995 a concept map is virtually identical to the notion of a semantic network ref name woods 1985 which has served as a cornerstone for much artificial intelligence work since its inception semantic networks too are directed graphs in which the nodes represent concepts and labeled edges the relationships between them much psychology research has strengthened the idea that the human mind internalizes knowledge in something very like this sort of framework this likely explains the ease with which concept mapping techniques have been adopted by the uninitiated since concept maps and semantic networks can be considered equivalent cognitive mapping cognitive mapping developed by fran ackermann and colin eden at the university of strathclyde uses the same data model as does concept mapping but with a new set of techniques in cognitive maps element names have two parts separated by an ellipsis that is read as opposed to in order to further clarify the semantics of the node cold hot is different from cold freezing for example links are of three types causal temporal connotative the first of which is the most common and is read as may lead to generally cognitive mapping is best suited to domains involving arguments and decision making cognitive mapping is not nearly as widespread as the other two paradigms together these and related methods have brought into the mainstream the idea of breaking down knowledge into its fundamental elements and representing them graphically students and workers from widely diverse backgrounds have experienced success in better articulating and examining their own knowledge and in discovering how it relates to what else they know although architectural considerations prevent any of these tools from functioning as bona fide pkbs the ideas they have contributed to a front end interface mechanism cannot be overestimated hypertext systems many in the hypertext community hypertext history reference vannevar bush s article as the cornerstone of their heritage hence the development of hypertext techniques while seldom applied specifically towards pkb solutions is important there have basically been three types of hypertext systems those that exploit features of non linear text to create a dynamic but coherent hyperdocument ref name schneiderman 1987 ref name goodman 1988 those that prescribe ways of linking existing documents together for navigation and expression of affinities ref name davis et al 1993 ref name garrett et al 1986 ref name pearl 1989 and those that use the hypertext model specifically to model abstract knowledge though the first and especially the second category have dominated research efforts and public enthusiasm over the past several decades it is this third class that is closest in spirit to the original vision of hypertext by its founders in a similar vein to vannevar bush bush doug engelbart s focus was to develop computer systems to help people think better he sought data models that more closely paralleled the human thought process and settled on using hypertext as a way to represent and store abstract human knowledge although his nls computer system augment system underwent many changes the original purpose closely aligned with that of pkbs ref name engelbart 1953 more recently randall trigg s textnet ref name trigg and weiser 1986 and notecards ref name halasz et al 1987 systems further explored this idea textnet revolved around primitive pieces of text connected with typed links to form a network similar in many ways to a semantic network ref name conklin and begeman 1988 though text centric it was clear that trigg s goal was to model the associations between primitive ideas and hence to reflect the mind s understanding by using structure meaning can be extracted from the relationships between chunks small pieces of text rather than from the words making them up ref name trigg and weiser 1986 the subsequent notecards effort was similarly designed to formulate structure compare and manage ideas it was useful for analyzing information constructing models formulating arguments designing artifacts and generally processing ideas conklin and begeman s gibis system was another early effort into true knowledge representation specifically for the field of design deliberations and arguments ref name conklin and begeman 1988 the project lived on in the later project questmap ref name selvin 1999 and the more modern compendium software compendium which has been primarily used for capturing group knowledge expressed in face to face meetings in all these cases systems use semantic hypertext in an attempt to capture shared knowledge in its most basic form other examples of knowledge based hypertext tools include mental link ref name dede and jayaram 1990 aquanet ref name marshall et al 1991 and sprint ref name carlson and ram 1990 as well as a few current commercial tools such as personalbrain and tinderbox application software tinderbox ref name bernstein 2003 and open source tools such as tiddlywiki note taking applications electronic notetaking note taking applications allow a user to create snippets of text and then organize or categorize them in some way these tools can be used to form pkbs that are composed of such text snippets most of these tools are based on a tree graph theory tree hierarchy in which the user can write pages of notes and then organize them into sections and subsections the higher level sections or chapters often receive a colored tab exactly as a physical three ring notebook might other designers eschew the tree model for a more flexible category based approach see section data models data models the primary purpose of all these tools is to offer the benefits of freeform note taking with none of the deficiencies users are free to brainstorm and jot down anything from bullet points to polished text while still being able to search rearrange and restructure the entire notebook easily an important subcategory of note taking tools is outliners e g omnioutliner or applications specifically designed to organize ideas in a hierarchy these tools typically show a two pane display with a tree like navigation widget in the left pane and a list of items in the right pane topics and subtopics can be rearranged and each outline stored in its own file modern outliners feature the ability to add graphics and other formatting to an item and even hyper links to external websites or documents the once abandoned but now resurrected ecco system was among the first to allow items to have typed attributes displayed in columns this gives the effect of a custom spreadsheet per topic with the topic s items as rows and the columns as attributes it allows the user to gracefully introduce structure to their information as it is identified of particular interest are applications optimized for subsuming portions of an information space realm into a pkb where they can be clustered and arranged according to the user s own perceptions the virtual notebook system vns ref name burger et al 1991 was one of the first to emphasize this vns was designed for sharing information among scientists at the baylor college of medicine a user s personal notebook could make references to specific sections of a community notebook and even include arbitrary segments of other documents through a cut and paste mechanism document management systems main document management system another influence on pkbs are systems whose primary purpose is to help users organize documents rather than personal knowledge derived from those documents such systems do not encode subjective knowledge per se but they do create a personal knowledge base of sorts by allowing users to organize and cross reference their information artifacts these efforts provide alternative indexing mechanisms to the limited directory path and file name approach presto ref name dourish et al 1999 replaces the directory hierarchy entirely with attributes that users assign to files these key value pairs represent user perceived properties of the documents and are used as a flexible means for retrieval and organization william jones memory extender ref name jones 1986 was similar in spirit but it dynamically varied the weight of a file s keywords according to the user s context and perceived access patterns in haystack mit project haystack ref name adar et al 1999 users in conjunction with automated software agents build a graph based network of associative links through which documents can be retrieved metadata and multiple categorization can also be applied to provide multiple retrieval paths customized to the way the individual thinks and works with their information sources webtop ref name wolber et al 2002 allowed the user to create explicit links between documents but then also merged these user defined relationships with other types of associations these included the hyperlinks contained in the documents associations implied by structural relationships and content similarities discovered by text analysis the idea was that any way in which items can be considered related should be made available to the user for help with retrieval a subclass of these systems integrate the user s personal workspace with a search facility blurring the distinction between information retrieval and information organization sketchtrieve ref name hendry and harper 1997 dlite ref name cousins et al 1997 and garnet ref name buchanan et al 2004 each materialized elements from the retrieval domain repositories queries search results into tangible manipulatable screen objects these could be introduced directly into a spatial layout that also included the information sources themselves these systems can be seen as combining a spatial hypertext interface as in viki ref name marshall and shipman 1995 with direct access to digital library search facilities navique ref name furnas and rauch 1998 was largely in the same vein though it incorporated a powerful similarity engine to proactively aid the user in organization cyclades ref name renda and straccia 2005 let users organize web pages into folders and then attempted to infer what each folder means to that user based on a statistical textual analysis of its contents this helps users locate other items similar to what s already in a folder learn what other users have found interesting and have grouped together etc all of these document management systems are principally concerned with organizing objective information sources rather than the expression of subjective knowledge yet their methods are useful to consider with respect to pkb systems because such a large part of our knowledge comprises things we remember assimilate and repurpose from objective sources search environments like sketchtrieve as well as snippet gatherers like yellowpen address an important need in knowledge management bridging the divide between the subjective and objective realms so that the former can make reference to and bring structure to the latter claims and benefits pkb systems make various claims about the advantages of using them these can be classified as follows ref name davies 2005 ref name davies 2011 knowledge generation and formulation here the emphasis is on procedure not persistence it is the act of simply using the tool to express one s knowledge that helps rather than the ability to retrieve it later knowledge capture pkbs do not merely allow one to express knowledge but also to capture it before it elusively disappears often the emphasis is on a streamlined user interface with few distractions and little encumbrance the point is to lower the burden of jotting down one s thoughts so that neither task nor thought process is interrupted knowledge organization a 2003 study on note taking habits found that better organization was the most commonly desired improvement in people s own information recording practices ref name hayes et al 2003 knowledge management and knowledge retrieval retrieval perhaps the most critical aspect of a pkb is that the knowledge it stores is permanent and accessible ready to be retrieved at any later time knowledge integration integrating heterogeneous sources recognizing that the knowledge people form comes from a variety of different places many pkb systems emphasize that the information from diverse sources and of different types can be integrated into a single database and interface data models see data model pkb systems can be compared along a number of different axes the most important of which is the underlying data model they support this is what prescribes and constrains the nature of the knowledge they can contain what types of knowledge elements are allowed how they can be structured and how the user perceives them and can interact with them ref name davies 2005 ref name davies 2011 three aspects of data models can be identified the structural framework which prescribes rules about how knowledge elements can be structured and interrelated the knowledge elements themselves or basic building blocks of information that a user creates and works with and schema which involves the level of formal semantics introduced into the data model structural frameworks the following structural frameworks have been featured in one or more prominent pkb systems tree systems that support a tree data structure tree model allow knowledge elements to be organized into a containment hierarchy in which each element has one and only one parent this takes advantage of the mind s natural tendency to classify objects into groups and to further break up each classification into subclassifications it also mimics the way that a document can be broken up into chapters sections and subsections it tends to be natural for users to understand all of the applications for creating buzan mind map mind maps are based on a tree model because a mind map is a tree each mind map has a root element in the center of the diagram often called a main topic from which all other elements emanate as descendents every knowledge element has one and only one place in this structure some tools such as mindmanager extend this paradigm by introducing floating topics which are not anchored to the hierarchy and permitting crosslinks to arbitrary topics similar to those in concept maps other examples of tree based systems are most personalized search interfaces ref name renda and straccia 2005 ref name di giacomo et al 2001 ref name reyes farfan and sanchez 2003 outliners and most of the notebook based note taking systems by allowing them to partition their notes into sections and subsections note taking tools channel users into a tree hierarchy in recognition of this confining limitation many of these tools also permit a kind of crosslink between items or employ some form of transclusion see below to allow items to co exist in several places the dominant paradigm in such tools however remains the simple parent child hierarchy graph graph based systems allow users to create knowledge elements and then to interconnect them in arbitrary ways the elements of a graph discrete mathematics graph are traditionally called vertices and connected by arcs though the terminology used by graph based systems varies widely see table 1 and the hypertext community normally uses the terms nodes and links there are no restrictions on how many arcs one vertex can have with others no notion of a parent child relationship between vertices unless the user chooses to label an arc with those semantics and normally no root vertex in many systems arcs can optionally be labeled with a word or phrase indicating the nature of the relationship and adorned with arrowheads on one or both ends to indicate navigability neither of these adornments is necessary with a tree since all relationships are implicitly labeled parent child and are navigable from parent to child a graph is a more general form of a tree and hence a strictly more powerful form of expression class wikitable terminology employed by a sampling of graph based knowledge tools system vertex arc graph axon idea

ideagraph knowledge manager concept relation map mylifebits resource link annotation story notecards note card link browser personalbrain thought link brain recallplus idea association diagram smart ideas symbol connector level this model is the defining characteristic of hypertext systems ref name halasz and schwartz 1994 including many of those used for document management ref name wolber et al 2002 ref name adar et al 1999 it is also the underpinning of all concept mapping tools whether they actually acknowledge the name concept maps ref name canas et al 2005 ref name gaines and shaw 1995 or advertise themselves simply as tools to draw knowledge diagrams as mentioned previously graphs draw their power from the fact that humans are thought to model knowledge as graphs or equivalently semantic networks internally in fact it could be argued that all human knowledge can be ultimately reduced to a graph of some kind which argues strongly for its sufficiency as a structural framework ref name quillian 1968 ref name nosek and roth 1990 an interesting aspect of graph based systems is whether or not they require a connectivity graph theory fully connected graph a fully connected graph is one in which every vertex can be reached from any other by simply performing enough arc traversals there are no islands of vertices that are severed from each other most graph based tools allow non fully connected graphs knowledge elements are added to the system and connected arbitrarily to each other without constraint but a few tools such as personalbrain and compendium software compendium actually require a single network of information in which every knowledge element must be indirectly connected to every other if one attempts to remove the last link that connects a body of nodes to the original root the severed elements are either forgotten or else moved to a deleted objects heap where they can only be accessed by restoring a connection to the rest of the graph some hypertext systems ref name garrett et al 1986 ref name delisle and schwartz 1986 add precision to the basic linking mechanism by allowing nodes to reference not only other nodes but sections within nodes ref name halasz and schwartz 1994 this ability is especially useful if the nodes themselves contain sizeable content and also for pkb elements making reference to fragments of objective sources tree plus graph although graphs are a strict superset of trees trees offer some important advantages in their own right simplicity familiarity ease of navigation and the ability to conceal details at any level of abstraction indeed the problem of disorientation in hypertext navigation ref name conklin and begeman 1988 ref name mantei 1982 largely disappears with the tree model one is never confused about where one is in the larger structure because traversing the parent hierarchy gives the context of the larger surroundings for this reason several graph based systems have incorporated special support for trees as well to combine the advantages of both approaches for instance in concept mapping techniques a generally hierarchical paradigm is prescribed after which users are encouraged to identify crosslinks between distant concepts similarly some systems using the mind mapping paradigm permit arbitrary relationships between nodes one of the earliest systems to combine tree and graph primitives was textnet ref name trigg and weiser 1986 which featured two types of nodes chunks which contained content to be browsed and organized and table of contents nodes or tocs any node could freely link to any other permitting an unrestricted graph but a group of tocs could be combined to form a tree like hierarchy that bottomed out in various chunk nodes in this way any number of trees could be superimposed upon an arbitrary graph allowing it to be viewed and browsed as a tree with all the requisite advantages strictly speaking a network of tocs formed a directed acyclic graph dag rather than a tree this means that a chunk could be represented in multiple places in the tree if two different traversal paths ended up referring to the same chunk a dag is essentially the result of applying transclusion to the tree model this is also true of notecards notecards ref name halasz et al 1987 offered a similar mechanism using fileboxes as the tree component that was overlaid upon the semantic network of notecards brown university s igd project explored various ways to combine and display unrestricted graphs with hierarchy and used a visual metaphor of spatial containment to convey both graph and tree structure ref name feiner 1988 their notion of link inheritance simplifies the way in which complex dual structures are displayed while still faithfully depicting their overall trends commercially both personalbrain and multicentrix ref name koy 1997 provide explicit support for parent child relationships in addition to arbitrary connections between elements allowing tree and graph notions to coexist some note taking tools while essentially tree based also permit crosslinks between notes spatial some designers have shunned links between elements altogether favoring instead spatial positioning as the sole organizational paradigm capitalizing on the human s tendency to implicitly organize through clustering making piles and spatially arranging some tools offer a 2d workspace for placing and grouping items this provides a less formal and perhaps less intimidating way for a user to gradually introduce structure into a set of items as it is discovered this approach originated from the spatial hypertext community demonstrated in various projects ref name disessa and abelson 1986 and viki vkb ref name marshall and shipman 1995 ref name shipman et al 2000 with these programs users place information items on a canvas and can manipulate them to convey organization imprecisely some project ref name marshall and shipman 1995 could infer the structure from a user s freeform layout a spatial parser examines which items have been clustered together colored or otherwise adorned similarly etc and makes judgments about how to turn these observations into machine processible assertions while others pad ref name perlin and fox 1993 allowed users to view different objects in varying levels of detail as they panned around the workspace certain note taking tools ref name burger et al 1991 ref name akscyn et al 1987 combine an overarching tree structure with spatial freedom on each frame or page users can access a particular page of the notebook with basic search or tree navigation facilities and then lay out notes and images on the page as desired many graph based approaches such as concept mapping tools also allow for arbitrary spatial positioning of elements this allows both kinds of relationships to be expressed explicit links and less formal expression through creative use of the screen categories in category based structural frameworks rather than being described in terms of their relationships to other elements as with a tree or graph items are simply grouped together in one or more categories indicating that they have something in common this scheme is based on the branch of pure mathematics called set theory in which each of a body of objects either has or does not have membership in each of some number of sets there is normally no restriction as to how many different categories a given item can belong to as is the case with mathematical sets users may think of categories as collections in which the category somehow encloses or owns the items within it indeed some systems depict categories in this fashion such as the vista interface ref name dourish et al 1999 where icons standing for documents are enclosed within ovals that represent categories this is merely a convention of display however and fundamentally categories are the same as simple keywords the most popular application to embrace the category approach was the original lotus agenda agenda ref name kaplan et al 1990 all information retrieval in agenda was performed in terms of category membership users specified queries that were lists of categories to include or exclude and only items that satisfied those criteria were displayed agenda was particularly sophisticated in that the categories themselves formed a tree hierarchy rather than a flat namespace assigning an item to a category also implicitly assigned it to all ancestors in the hierarchy personal knowbase is a more modern commercial product based solely on a keyword category paradigm though it uses a simple flat keyword structure rather than an inheritance hierarchy like agenda haystack mit project haystack ref name adar et al 1999 and open source applications foundation chandler are other information management tools which use categorization in important ways william jones memory extender ref name jones 1986 took an artificial intelligence twist on the whole notion of keywords categories by allowing an item s keywords to be weighted and adjusted over time by both the user and the system this allowed the strength of category membership to vary dynamically for each of an item s assignments in an attempt to yield more precise retrieval chronological yale university s lifestreams project ref name fertig et al 1996 used timestamps as the principal means of organization and retrieval of personal documents in fertig et al s own words blockquote a lifestreaming lifestream is a time ordered stream of documents that functions as a diary of your electronic life every document you create is stored in your lifestream as are the documents other people send you the tail of your stream contains documents from the past perhaps starting with your electronic birth certificate moving away from the tail and toward the present your stream contains more recent documents such as papers in progress or the latest electronic mail you ve received blockquote documents are thus always ordered and accessed chronologically metadata based queries on the collection produce substreams or chronologically ordered subsets of the original documents the rationale for time based ordering is that time is a natural guide to experience it is the attribute that comes closest to a universal skeleton key for stored experience ref name freeman and gelernter 1996 whether chronology is our principal or even a common natural coding mechanism psychologically can be debated but since any pkb system can easily create such an index it seems worthwhile to follow lifestreams lead and allow the user to sort and retrieve based on time as many systems have done if nothing else it relieves the user from having to create names for knowledge elements since the timestamp is always an implicit identifying mark planplus based on the franklin covey planner system is also chronologically modeled and a number of products based on other data models ref name kaplan et al 1990 offer chronological indexing in addition to their core paradigm aquanet s framework though advertised as a hypertext system marshall et al s aquanet ref name marshall et al 1991 went far beyond the traditional node link graph model knowledge expressed in aquanet is centered around relations or n ary links between objects in which the semantics of each participant in the relation is specified by the relation type each type of relation specifies a physical display i e how it will be drawn on the screen and the spatial positioning of each of its participants and a number of slots into which participants can be plugged each participant in a relation can be either a base object or another relation users can thus define a schema of relation types and then build a complex semantic model out of relations and objects since relation types can be specified to associate any number of nodes instead of just two as in the graph model this potentially allows more complex relationships to be expressed it should be noted however that the same effect can be achieved in the basic graph model by simply taking the n ary relations and reifying them i e turning them into nodes in their own right for instance suppose we define a relation type assassination with slot types of assassin victim location and weapon we could then create a relation based on this type where the participants are john wilkes booth abraham lincoln ford s theatre and derringer this allows us to express a complex relationship between multiple objects in aquanet but we can express the same knowledge with the basic graph model by simply creating a node called lincoln s assassination and then creating typed links between that node and the other four labeled assassin victim etc aquanet s biggest achievement in this area is the ability to express the schema of relation types so that the types of objects an assassination relation can connect are consistent and enforced knowledge elements there are several options for specifying what knowledge elements consist of and what kind of internal structure if any they possess word phrase concept most systems engineered for knowledge representation encourage structures to be composed of very simple elements usually words or phrases this is in the spirit of both mind mapping and concept mapping where users are encouraged to use simple phrases to stand for mental concepts free text notes nearly all systems permit large amounts of free text to exist in the pkb either as the contents of the elements themselves notecards ref name halasz et al 1987 hypercard ref name goodman 1988 treepad or attached to elements as separate supplementary pages agenda ref name kaplan et al 1990 zoot hogbay links to an information space since a user s knowledge base is to correspond to her mental perceptions it seems profitable for the pkb to point to entities in the information space from which she formed those perceptions many systems do in fact allow their knowledge elements to point to the original sources in some way there are three common techniques the knowledge element actually represents an original source this is the case for document management systems webtop ref name wolber et al 2002 mylifebits ref name gemmell et al 2002 haystack ref name adar et al 1999 integrated search facilities navique ref name furnas and rauch 1998 cyclades ref name renda and straccia 2005 viki vkb ref name marshall and shipman 1995 ref name shipman et al 2000 tinderbox ref name bernstein 2003 will also allow one of its notes to be a url and the user can control whether its contents should be captured once or auto fetched as to receive constant web updates many systems in addition to storing a page of free text for each knowledge element also permit any number of hyperlinks to be attached to a knowledge element e g freemind freemind personalbrain inspiration vns ref name burger et al 1991 which allows users to point to a community notebook page from within their personal notebook gives similar functionality the knowledge element is a repurposed snippet from an original source this is potentially the most powerful form but is rare among fully featured pkb systems cartagio hunter gatherer ref name schraefel et al 2002 and yellowpen all allow web page excerpts to be assimilated and organized although they primarily only do that without allowing them to easily be combined with other subjective knowledge devonthink and mybase s webcollect plug in add similar functionality to their more general purpose tree based information managers both of these systems when a snippet is captured archive the entire web page locally so it can be returned to later the user interfaces of circusponies and stickybrain have been heavily optimized towards grabbing information from other applications and bringing them into the pkb without disturbing the user s workflow composites some programs allow a user to embed knowledge elements and perhaps other information as well inside a knowledge element to form an implicit hierarchy trees by themselves fall into this category of course since each node in the tree can be considered a composite of its content and children but a few graph based tools offer composite functionality as well in aquanet ref name marshall et al 1991 relations form the fundamental means of connection and the units that are plugged into a relation can be not only objects but other relations as well this lends a recursive quality to a user s modeling viki vkb s spatial environment offers subspaces which let a user partition their visual workspace into subregions whose internal contents can be viewed at a glance from the parent boxer s ref name disessa and abelson 1986 paradigm is similar tinderbox is a graph based tool that supports hierarchical composite structures and compendium software compendium extends this even further by allowing transclusion of views as well as of nodes unlike the other tools in compendium the composite hierarchy does not form a directed acyclic graph dag but rather an arbitrary graph view a can appear on view b and b can in turn appear on a the user s intuitive notion of inside must be adapted somewhat in this case schema in the context of pkbs schema means the ability for a user to specify types and introduce structure to aspects of the data model it is a form of metadata whereby more precise semantics can be applied to various elements of the system this facilitates more formal knowledge expression ensures consistency across items of the same kind and can better allows automated agents to process the information both knowledge elements and links can contain various aspects of schema schema for knowledge elements types and related schema in a pkb a type system allows users to specify that a knowledge element is a member of a specific class or category or items to provide a built in method of organization and retrieval generally speaking systems can make knowledge elements untyped rigidly typed or flexibly typed in addition they can incorporate some notion of inheritance among elements and their types there is a distinction between types and categories here a category based scheme typically allows any number of categories keywords to be assigned to an item there are two differences between this and the notion of type first items are normally restricted to being of a single type and this usually indicates a more intrinsic permanent property of an item than simply its presence in a category collection for example one could imagine an item called xyz corporation shifting into and out of categories like competitors overseas distributors or delinquent debtors over time but its core type of company would probably be static for all time second types often carry structural specifications with them if an item is of a given type this means it will have values for certain attributes appropriate to that type some systems that do not allow typing offer the ability to approximate this function through categories untyped elements are typical among informal knowledge capture tools since they are designed to stimulate brainstorming and help users discover their nascent mental models these tools normally want to avoid forcing the user to commit to structure prematurely most mind mapping and many concept mapping tools are in this category a concept is simply a word or phrase with no other semantic information e g visual mind note taking tools also usually take this approach with all units of information being of the same type note at the other extreme are tools which like older relational database technology require all items to be declared as of a specific type when they are created often this type dictates the internal structure of the element these tools are better suited to domains in which the structure of knowledge to be captured is predictable well understood and known in advance for pkb systems they are probably overly restrictive kmap ref name gaines and shaw 1995 and compendium are examples of tools that allow and require each item to be typed in their case the type controls the visual appearance of the item rather than any internal structure in between these two poles are systems that permit typed and untyped elements to co exist notetaker is such a product it holds simple free text pages of notes without any structure but also lets the user define templates with predefined fields that can be used to instantiate uniformly structured forms treepad has a similar feature some other systems blur the distinction between typed and untyped allowing the graceful introduction of structure as it is discovered vkb ref name shipman et al 2000 for example supports an elegant flexible typing scheme well suited to pkbs items in general consist of an arbitrary number of attribute value pair s but when consistent patterns emerge across a set of objects the user can create a type for that group and with it a list of expected attributes and default values this structure can be selectively overridden by individual objects however which means that even objects assigned to a particular type have flexible customization available to them tinderbox offers an alternate way of achieving this flexibility as described below finally the object oriented notion of inheritance computer science type inheritance is available in a few solutions the different card types in notecards are arranged into an inheritance hierarchy so that new types can be created as extensions of old aquanet extends this to multiple inheritance among types the slots that an object contains are those of its type plus those of all supertypes sprint and tinderbox also use a frame based approach and allow default values for attributes to be inherited from supertypes this way an item need not define values for all its attributes explicitly unless overridden an item s slot will have the shared default value for all items of that type other forms of schema in addition to the structure that is controlled by an item s type other forms of metadata and schema can be applied to knowledge elements keywords many systems let users annotate items with user defined keywords here the distinction between an item s contents and the overall knowledge structure becomes blurred since an item keyword could be considered either a property of the item or an organizational mechanism that groups it into a category with like items systems using the category data model e g agenda can employ keywords for the latter purpose some systems based on other data models also use keywords to achieve category like functionality attribute value pairs arbitrary attribute value pairs can also be attached to elements in many systems which gives a pkb the ability to define semantic structure that can be queried frame based systems like sprint and aquanet are examples as well as notetaker vkb and tinderbox mindpad aks labs 2005 is notable for taking the basic concept mapping paradigm and introducing schema to it via its model editor as mentioned earlier adding user defined attribute value pairs to the items in an outliner yields spreadsheet like functionality as in ecco and omnioutliner some systems feature attribute value pairs but only in the form of system defined attributes not user defined ones knowledge element appearance some tools modify a knowledge element s visual appearance on the screen in order to convey meaning to the user smart ideas and visual mind let the user freely choose each element s icon from a variety of graphics while kmap ref name gaines and shaw 1995 ties the icon directly to its underlying type other graphical aspects that can be modified include color viki ref name marshall and shipman 1995 the set of attributes shown in a particular context vkb ref name shipman et al 2000 and the spatial positioning of objects in a relation aquanet ref name marshall et al 1991 schema for links in addition to prescribing schema for knowledge elements many systems allow some form of information to be attached to the links that connect them in most of the early hypertext systems links were unnamed and untyped their function being merely to associate two items in an unspecified manner the mind mapping paradigm also does not name links but for a different reason the implicit type of every link is one of generalization specialization associating a topic with a subtopic hence specifying types for the links would be redundant and labeling them would clutter the diagram concept mapping prescribes the naming of links such that the precise nature of the relationship between two concepts is made clear as mentioned above portions of a concept map are meant to be read as english sentences with the name of the link serving as a verb phrase connecting the two concepts numerous systems thus allow a word or phrase to decorate the links connecting elements named links can be distinguished from typed links however if the text attached to a link is an arbitrary string of characters unrelated to that of any other link it can be considered the link name some systems however encourage the re use of link names that the user has defined previously in personalbrain for instance before specifying the nature of a link the user must create an appropriate link type associated with a color to be used in presentation in the system wide database and then assign that type to the link in question this promotes consistency among the names chosen for links so that the same logical relationship types will hopefully have the same tags throughout the knowledge base this feature also facilitates searches based on link type among other things other systems especially those suited for specific domains such as decision modeling gibis ref name conklin and begeman 1988 and banxia decision explorer predefine a set of link types that can be assigned but not altered by the user some more advanced systems allow links to bear attribute value pairs themselves and even embedded structure similar to those of the items they connect in haystack ref name adar et al 1999 this is the case since links ties and nodes needles are actually defined as subtypes of a common type straw kmap similarly defines a link as a subclass of node which allows links to represent n ary relationships between nodes and enables recursive structure within a link itself it is unclear how much value this adds in knowledge modeling or how often users take advantage of such a feature neptune ref name delisle and schwartz 1986 and intermedia ref name garrett et al 1986 are two older systems that also support attributes for links albeit in a simpler manner another aspect of links that generated much fervor in the early hypertext systems was that of link precision rather than merely connecting one element to another systems like intermedia defined anchors within documents so that a particular snippet within a larger element could be linked to another snippet the dexter model ref name halasz and schwartz 1994 covers this issue in detail for pkb purposes this seems to be most relevant as regards links to the objective space as discussed previously if the pkb truly contains knowledge expressed in appropriately fine grained parts then link precision between elements in the knowledge base is much less of a consideration this discussion on links has only considered connections between knowledge elements in the system where the system has total control over both ends of the connection as described in the previous section numerous systems provide the ability to link from a knowledge element inside the system to some external resource a file or a url say these external links typically cannot be enhanced with any additional information and serve only as convenient retrieval paths rather than as aspects of knowledge representation architecture the idea of a pkb gives rise to some important architectural considerations while not constraining the nature of what knowledge can be expressed the architecture nevertheless affects more mundane matters such as availability and workflow but even more importantly the system s architecture determines whether it can truly function as a lifelong integrated knowledge store the base aspect of the personal knowledge base defined above file based traditionally most electronic pkb systems have employed a simple storage mechanism based on flat files in a filesystem this is true of virtually all of the mind mapping tools mindmanager concept mapping tools and even a number of hypertext tools notecards ref name halasz et al 1987 hypercard ref name goodman 1988 tinderbox ref name bernstein 2003 typically the main unit of a user s knowledge design whether that be a mind map a concept map an outline or a notebook is stored in its own file somewhere in the filesystem the application can find and load such files via the familiar file open paradigm at which point it typically maintains the entire knowledge structure in memory the advantage of such a paradigm is familiarity and ease of use the disadvantage is a possibly negative influence on knowledge formulation users must choose one of two basic strategies either store all of their knowledge in a single file or else break up their knowledge and store it across a number of different files presumably according to subject matter and or time period the first choice can result in scalability problems consider how much knowledge a user might collect over a decade if they stored things related to their personal life hobbies relationships reading materials vacations academic course notes multiple work related projects future planning etc it seems unrealistic to keep adding this kind of volume to a single ever growing multi gigabyte file the other option however is also constraining each bit of knowledge can be stored in only one of the files or else redundantly which leads to synchronization problems and the user is forced to choose this at knowledge capture time database based if a pkb s data is stored in a database system then knowledge elements reside in a global space which allows any idea to relate to any other now a user can relate a book he read on productivity not only to other books on productivity but also to that hotel in orlando that our family stayed in last spring because that is where he remembers having read the book though such a relationship may seem out of bounds in traditional knowledge organization it is exactly the kind of retrieval path that humans often employ in retrieving memories ref name lorayne and lucas 1974 ref name anderson 1990 ref name conway et al 1991 the database architecture enables a pkb to truly form an integrated knowledge base and contain the full range of relationships agenda ref name kaplan et al 1990 and gibis ref name conklin and begeman 1988 were two early tools that subsumed a database backend in their architecture more recently the mylifebits project ref name gemmell et al 2002 uses microsoft sql server as its storage layer and compendium software compendium interfaces with the open source mysql database a few note taking applications also store information in an integrated database rather than in user named files the only significant drawback to this architectural choice other than the modest footprint of the database management system is that data is more difficult to copy and share across systems this is one true advantage of files it is a simple matter to copy them across a network or include them as an e mail attachment where they can be read by the same application on a different machine this problem is solved by some of the following architectural choices client server decoupling the actual knowledge store from the pkb user interface can achieve architectural flexibility as with all client server architectures the benefits include load distribution platform interoperability data sharing and ubiquitous availability increased complexity and latency are among the liabilities which can indeed be considerable factors in pkb design one of the earliest and best examples of a client server knowledge base was the neptune hypertext system ref name delisle and schwartz 1986 neptune was tailored to the task of maintaining shared information within software engineering teams rather than to personal knowledge storage but the elegant implementation of its hypertext abstract machine ham was a significant and relevant achievement the ham was a generic hypertext storage layer that provided node and link storage and maintained version history of all changes application layers and user interfaces were to be built on top of the ham architecturally the ham provided distributed network access so that client applications could run from remote locations and still access the central store another more recent example is the scholarly ontologies project ref name uren et al 2004 ref name sereno et al 2005 whose claimapper and claimaker components form a similar distributed solution in order to support collaboration these systems implemented a distributed architecture primarily in order to share data among colleagues for pkbs the prime motive is rather user mobility this is a key consideration since if a user is to store all of their knowledge into a single integrated store they will certainly need access to it in a variety of settings mybase networking edition is one example of how this might be achieved a central server hosts the user s data and allows network access from any client machine clients can view the knowledge base from within the mybase application or through a web browser with limited functionality the haystack project ref name adar et al 1999 outlines a three tiered architecture which allows the persistent store the haystack data model itself and the clients that access it to reside on separate machines the interface to the middle tier is flexible enough that a number of different persistent storage models can be used including relational databases semistructured databases and object oriented databases presto s architecture ref name dourish et al 1999 exhibits similar features web based a variation of the client server approach is web based systems in which the client system consists of nothing but a possibly enhanced browser this gives the same ubiquitous availability that client server approaches do while minimizing or eliminating the setup and installation required on each client machine kmap ref name gaines and shaw 1995 was one of the first knowledge systems to integrate with the world wide web it allowed concept maps to be shared edited and remotely stored using the http protocol concept maps were still created using a standalone client application for the macintosh but they could be uploaded to a central server and then rendered in browsers as clickable gifs clicking on a concept within the map image in the browser window would have the same navigation effect as clicking on it locally inside the client application the user s knowledge expressions are stored on a central server in nearly all cases rather than locally on the browser s machine handheld devices lastly mobile devices are a possible pkb architecture storing all of one s personal knowledge on a pda would solve the availability problem of course and even more completely than would a client server or web based architecture the safety of the information is an issue since if the device were to be lost or destroyed the user could face irrevocable data loss this is easily remedied however by periodically synchronizing the device s contents with a host computer most handheld applications are simple note taking software with far fewer features than their desktop counterparts bugme is an immensely popular note taking tool that simply lets users enter text or scribble onto notes screenfulls of space and then organize them in primitive ways screen shots can be captured and included as graphics and the tool features an array of drawing tools clip art libraries etc the value add for this and similar tools is purely the size and convenience of the handheld device not the ability to manage large amounts of information perhaps the most effective use of a handheld architecture would be as a satellite data capture and retrieval utility a user would normally employ a fully functional desktop application for personal knowledge management but when on the go they could capture knowledge into a compatible handheld application and upload it to their pkb at a later convenient time to enable mobile knowledge retrieval either select information would need to be downloaded to the device before the user needed it or else a wireless client server solution could deliver any part of the pkb on demand this is essentially the approach taken by software like keysuite which supplements a feature rich desktop information management tool e g microsoft outlook microsoft outlook by providing access to that information on the mobile device see also commonplace book lifelog notetaking comparison of notetaking software outliner personal knowledge

able to ignore the qualifier and treat the metadata value as if it were an unqualified broader element while this may result in some loss of specificity the remaining element value without the qualifier should continue to be generally correct and useful for discovery in addition to element refinements qualified dublin core includes a set of recommended encoding schemes designed to aid in the interpretation of an element value these schemes include controlled vocabularies and formal notations or parsing rules a value expressed using an encoding scheme may thus be a token selected from a controlled vocabulary for example a term from a classification system or set of subject headings or a string formatted in accordance with a formal notation for example 2000 12 31 as the iso standard

classification is a system by which library resources are arranged according to subject library classifications use a notational system that represents the order of topics in the classification and allows items to be stored in that order library classification systems group related materials together typically arranged in a hierarchical tree structure a different kind of classification system called a faceted classification system is also widely used which allows the assignment of multiple classifications to an object enabling the classifications to be ordered in multiple ways the library

location new york ref types there are many standard systems of library classification in use and many more have been proposed over the years however in general classification systems can be divided into three types depending on how they are used universal schemes which cover all subjects for example the dewey decimal classification universal decimal classification and library of congress classification specific classification schemes which cover particular subjects or types of materials for example iconclass british catalogue of music classification and dickinson classification or the nlm classification for medicine national schemes which are specially created for certain countries for example the sweden swedish library classification system sab sveriges allm\xc3\xa4nna biblioteksf\xc3\xb6rening in terms of functionality classification systems are often described as enumeration enumerative subject headings are listed alphabetically with numbers assigned to each heading in alphabetical order hierarchy hierarchical subjects are divided hierarchically from most general to most specific faceted classification faceted or analytico synthetic subjects are divided into mutually exclusive orthogonal facets there are few completely enumerative systems or faceted systems most systems are a blend but favouring one type or the other the most common classification systems lcc and ddc are essentially enumerative though with some hierarchical and faceted elements more so for ddc especially at the broadest and most general level the first true faceted system was the colon classification of s r ranganathan methods or systems classification types denote the classification or categorization according the form or characteristics or qualities of a classification

synthesis faceted systems bliss bibliographic classification colon classification cutter expansive classification universal decimal classification newer classification systems tend to use the principle of synthesis combining codes from different lists to represent the different attributes of a work heavily which is comparatively lacking in lc or ddc the practice of classifying library classification is associated with library descriptive cataloging under the rubric of cataloging and classification sometimes grouped together as technical services the library professional who engages in the process of cataloging and classifying library materials is called a cataloger or catalog librarian library classification systems are one of the two tools used to facilitate subject access the other consists of alphabetical indexing languages such as thesauri and subject headings systems library classification of a piece of work consists of two steps firstly the aboutness of the material is ascertained next a call number essentially a book s address based on the classification system in use at the particular library will be assigned to the work using the notation of the system it is important to note that unlike subject heading or thesauri where multiple terms can be assigned to the same work in library classification systems each work can only be placed in one class this is due to shelving purposes a book can have only one physical place however in classified catalogs one may have main entries as well as added entries most classification systems like the dewey decimal classification ddc and library of congress classification also add a cutter number to each work which adds a code for the author of the work classification systems in libraries generally play two roles firstly they facilitate subject access by allowing the user to find out what works or documents the library has on a certain subject ref cite web url http www iva dk bh lifeboat ko concepts subject access points htm title subject access points work iva dk ref secondly they provide a known location for the information source to be located e g where it is shelved until the 19th century most libraries had closed stacks so the library classification only served to organize the subject library catalog catalog in the 20th century libraries opened their stacks to the public and started to shelve library material itself according to some library classification to simplify subject browsing some classification systems are more suitable for aiding subject access rather than for shelf location for example universal decimal classification which uses a complicated notation of pluses and colons is more difficult to use for the purpose of shelf arrangement but is more expressive compared to ddc in terms of showing relationships between subjects similarly faceted classification schemes are more difficult to use for shelf arrangement unless the user has knowledge of the citation order depending on the size of the library collection some libraries might use classification systems solely for one purpose or the other in extreme cases a public library with a small collection might just use a classification system for location of resources but might not use a complicated subject classification system instead all resources might just be put into a couple of wide classes travel crime magazines etc this is known as a mark and park classification method more formally called reader interest classification ref lynch sarah n and eugene mulero http www nytimes com

history use of enumeration hierarchy and facets classification systems can differ in the following ways type of notation notation can be pure consisting of only numerals for example or mixed consisting of letters and numerals or letters numerals and other symbols expressiveness this is the degree to which the notation can express relationship between concepts or structure whether they support mnemonics for example the number 44 in ddc notation often means it concerns some aspect of france for example in the dewey classification 598 0944 concerns birds in france the 09 signifies geographical division and 44 represents france hospitality the degree to which the system is able to accommodate new subjects brevity the length of the notation to express the same concept speed of

the world containing the objects concepts and other entities that are presumed of interest for some particular purpose and the relationships between them ref name gruber ref name smith an explicit specification of a conceptualization is an ontology information science ontology and it may occur that a conceptualization can be realized by several distinct ontologies ref name gruber an ontological commitment in describing ontological comparisons is taken to refer to that subset of elements of an ontology shared with all the others ref name audi ref name ceccaroni1 an ontology is language dependent its objects and interrelations described within the language it uses while a conceptualization is always the same more general its concepts existing independently of the language used to describe it ref name guarino the relation between these terms is shown in the figure to the right not all workers in knowledge engineering use the term conceptualization but instead refer to the conceptualization itself or to the ontological commitment of all its realizations as an overarching ontology ref name ceccaroni purpose and implementation as a higher level abstraction a conceptualization facilitates the discussion and comparison of its various ontologies facilitating knowledge sharing and reuse ref name ceccaroni ref name harmelen each ontology based upon the same overarching conceptualization maps the conceptualization into specific elements and their relationships the question then arises as to how to describe the conceptualization in terms that can encompass multiple ontologies this issue has been called the tower of babel problem that is how can persons used to one ontology talk with others using a different ontology ref name smith ref name harmelen this problem is easily grasped but a general resolution is not at hand it can be a bottom up or a top down approach or something in between ref name alignment however in more artificial situations such as information systems the idea of a conceptualization and the ontological commitment of various ontologies that realize the conceptualization is possible ref name guarino ref name guarino1 the formation of a conceptualization and its ontologies involves these steps ref name hadzic specification of the conceptualization ontology concepts every definition involves the definitions of other terms relationships between the concepts this step maps conceptual relationships onto the ontology structure groups of concepts this step may lead to the creation of sub ontologies formal description of ontology commitments for example to make them computer readable an example of moving conception into a language leading to a variety of ontologies is the expression of a process in pseudocode a strictly structured form of ordinary language leading to implementation in several different formal computer languages like lisp programming language lisp or fortran the pseudocode makes it easier to understand the instructions and compare implementations but the formal languages make possible the compilation of the ideas as computer instructions citation needed date august 2013 another example is mathematics where a very general formulation the analog of a conceptualization is illustrated with applications that are more specialized examples for instance aspects of a function space can be illustrated using a vector space or a topological space that introduce interpretations of the elements of the conceptualization and additional relationships between them but preserve the connections

b'about spatial temporal reasoning in information technology spatial temporal reasoning in psychology spatial visualization ability technical date october 2012 spatial temporal reasoning is an area of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence which draws from the fields of computer science cognitive science and cognitive psychology the theoretic goal on the cognitive side involves representing and reasoning spatial temporal knowledge in mind the applied goal on the computing side involves developing high level control systems of robots for navigating and understanding time and space influence from cognitive psychology a convergent result in cognitive psychology is that the connection relation is the first spatial relation that human babies acquire followed by understanding orientation relations and distance relations internal relations among the three kinds of spatial relations can be computationally and systematically explained within the theory of cognitive prism as follows 1 the connection relation is primitive 2 an orientation relation is a distance comparison relation you being in front of me can be interpreted as you are nearer to my front side than my other sides 3 a distance relation is connection relations using a third object you being one meter away from me can be interpreted as an object with the maximum extension of one meter can be connected with you and me simultaneously fragmentary representations of temporal calculi without addressing internal relations among spatial relations ai researchers contributed many fragmentary representations examples of temporal calculi include allen s interval algebra and vilain s kautz s point algebra the most prominent spatial calculi are mereotopology mereotopological calculi andrew u frank frank s cardinal direction calculus freksa s double cross calculus egenhofer and franzosa s 9 intersection calculus 4 and 9 intersection calculi ligozat s flip flop calculus various region connection calculus region connection calculi rcc and the oriented point relation algebra recently spatio temporal calculi have been designed that combine spatial and temporal information for example the spatiotemporal constraint calculus stcc by gerevini and nebel combines allen s interval algebra with rcc 8 moreover the qualitative trajectory calculus qtc allows for reasoning about moving objects quantitative abstraction an emphasis in the literature has been on qualitative reasoning qualitative spatial temporal reasoning which is based on qualitative abstractions of temporal and spatial aspects of the common sense background knowledge on which our human perspective of physical reality is based methodologically qualitative constraint satisfaction constraint calculi restrict the vocabulary of rich mathematical theories dealing with temporal or spatial entities such that specific aspects of these theories can be treated within decidability logic decidable fragments with simple qualitative non metric mathematics metric languages contrary to mathematical or physical theories about space and time qualitative constraint calculi allow for rather inexpensive reasoning about entities located in space and time for this reason the limited expressiveness of qualitative representation formalism calculi is a benefit if such reasoning tasks need to be integrated in applications for example some of these calculi may be implemented for handling spatial geographic information system gis queries efficiently and some may be used for navigating and communicating with a mobile robot relation algebra most of these calculi can be formalized as abstract relation algebra s such that reasoning can be carried out at a symbolic level for computing solutions of a constraint network the local consistency path consistency path consistency algorithm is an important tool software http www sfbtr8 spatial cognition de de projekte reasoning r4 logospace research tools gqr gqr constraint network solver for

1977 was a pioneer of establishing a library classification system for chinese language materials in the united states of america the system devised by him was known as harvard yenching classification system the system was primarily created for the classification of chinese language materials in the harvard yenching library which was founded in 1927 at the harvard yenching institute ref eugene w wu the founding of the harvard yenching library journal of east asian libraries 101 1 1993 65 69 http scholarsarchive byu edu jeal vol1993 iss101 16 ref during that early period other systems such as the early edition of the library of congress classification did not consist of appropriate subject headings to classify the chinese language materials particularly the ancient published materials as many american libraries started to collect the ancient and contemporary published materials from china a number of american libraries subsequently followed harvard university to adopt harvard yenching classification system such as the east asian library of the university of california in berkeley columbia university the university of chicago washington university in st louis etc in addition to american libraries the libraries of other universities in the world including england australia new zealand hong kong singapore etc also followed harvard university to adopt the system during the period from the 1930s to the 1970s the use of the system became popular for classifying not only chinese language materials but also other east asian materials including korean and japanese language materials during the period from the 1970s to the 1980s a comprehensive subset of subject headings for chinese language materials was gradually established in the library of congress classification system so that almost a full spectrum of ancient and contemporary chinese topics can be widely covered as a result of this the library of congress classification system eventually replaced the harvard yenching classification system for all chinese language materials acquired after the 1970s in many american libraries though the system has largely been phased out the system is still being used in some libraries for chinese language materials acquired prior to the library of congress update such previously acquired books are normally stored in separate stacks in libraries however some of the university libraries in the commonwealth countries of the united kingdom such as england australia and new zealand still continue to use the harvard yenching system for example the institute for

b'file flock of birds at rome ogg right 300px thumb although this flock is made of the same type of bird each individual bird is a different token 50 mb video of a flock birds flock of birds in rome thumbtime 6 the type token distinction is used in disciplines such as logic linguistics metalogic typography and computer programming to clarify what words mean the sentence they drive the same car is ambiguous do they drive the same type of car the same model or the same instance of a car type a single vehicle clarity requires us to distinguish words that represent abstract types from words that represent objects that embody or exemplify types the type token distinction separates types representing abstract descriptive concepts from tokens representing objects that instantiate concepts for example bicycle is a type that represents the concept of a bicycle whereas my bicycle is a token that represents an object that instantiates that type in the sentence the bicycle is becoming more popular the word bicycle is a type representing a concept whereas in the sentence the bicycle is in the garage the word bicycle is a token representing a particular object the distinction in computer programming between class software classes and object computer science objects is related though in this context class sometimes refers to a set of objects with class level attribute or operations rather than a description of an object in the set the words type concept property quality feature and attribute all used in describing things tend to be used with different verbs e g suppose a rose bush is defined as a plant that is thorny flowering and bushy you might say a rose bush instantiates these three types or embodies these three concepts or exhibits these three properties or possesses these three qualities features or attributes property types e g height in metres or thorny are often understood ontology ontologically as concepts property instances e g height 1 74 are sometimes understood as measured values and sometimes understood as sensations or observations of reality some say types exist in descriptions of objects but not as tangible physical object s they say one can show someone a particular bicycle but cannot show someone the type bicycle as in the bicycle is popular however types do exist in sense that they appear in mental and documented models some say tokens represent objects that are tangible exist in space and time as physical matter and or energy however tokens can represent intangible objects of types such as thought tennis match government and act of kindness occurrences there is a related distinction very closely connected with the type token distinction this distinction is the distinction between an object or type of object and an occurrence of it in this sense an occurrence is not necessarily a token considering the sentence a rose is a rose is a rose we may equally correctly state that there are eight or three words in the sentence there are in fact three word types in the sentence rose is and a there are eight word tokens in a token copy of the line the line itself is a type there are not eight word types in the line it contains as stated only the three word types a is and rose each of which is unique so what do we call what there are eight of they are occurrences of words there are three occurrences of the word type a two of is and three of rose the need to distinguish tokens of types from occurrences of types arises not just in linguistics but whenever types of things have other types of things occurring in them ref

writes the alphabet 26 new letters have been created the word letters was used three times in the above paragraph each time in a different meaning the word letters is one of many words having type token ambiguity this section disambiguates letters by separating the three senses using terminology standard in logic today the key distinctions were first made by the american logician philosopher charles sanders peirce in 1906 using terminology that he established ref charles sanders peirce prolegomena to an apology for pragmaticism monist vol 16 1906 pp 492 546 ref the letters that are created by writing are physical objects that can be destroyed by various means these are letter tokens or letter inscriptions the 26 letters of the alphabet are letter types or letter forms peirce s

bulletin of symbolic logic vol 12 2006 pp 219 40 ref namely letter but every time that word type is written a new word token has been created some logicians consider a word type to be the class of its tokens other logicians counter that the word type has a permanence and constancy not found in the class of its tokens the type remains the same while the class of its tokens is continually gaining new members and losing old members the word type letter uses only four letter types el ee tee and ar nevertheless it uses ee twice and tee twice in standard terminology the word type letter has six letter occurrences and the letter type ee occurs twice in the word type letter whenever a word type is inscribed the number of letter tokens created equals the number of letter occurrences in the word type peirce s original words are the following a common mode of estimating the amount of matter in a printed book is to count the number of words there will ordinarily be about twenty thes on a page and of course they count as twenty words in another sense of the word word however there is but one word the in the english language and it is impossible that this word should lie visibly on a page or be heard in any voice such a form i propose to term a type a single object such as this or that word on a single line of a single page of a single copy of a book i will venture to call a token in order that a type may be used it has to be embodied in a token which shall be a sign of the type and thereby of the object the type signifies peirce 1906 ogden richards 1923 280 1 these distinctions are subtle but solid and easy to master this section ends using the new terminology to disambiguate the first paragraph there are 26 letter types in the english alphabet and yet there are more than 26

b'file chow liu png thumb 400 px a first order dependency tree representing the product on the left in probability theory and statistics chow liu tree is an efficient method for constructing a second orders of approximation order product approximation of a joint probability distribution first described in a paper by harvtxt chow liu 1968 the goals of such a decomposition as with such bayesian networks in general may be either data compression or inference the chow liu representation the chow liu method describes a joint probability distribution math p x 1 x 2 ldots x n math as a product of second order conditional and marginal distributions for example the six dimensional distribution math p x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 math might be approximated as math p prime x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 p x 6 x 5 p x 5 x 2 p x 4 x 2 p x 3 x 2 p x 2 x 1 p x 1 math where each new term in the product introduces just one new variable and the product can be represented as a first order dependency tree as shown in the figure the chow liu algorithm below determines which conditional probabilities are to be used in the product approximation in general unless there are no third order or higher order interactions the chow liu approximation is indeed an approximation and cannot capture the complete structure of the original distribution harvtxt pearl 1988 provides a modern analysis of the chow liu tree as a bayesian network the chow liu algorithm chow and liu show how to select second order terms for the product approximation so that among all such second order approximations first order dependency trees the constructed approximation math p prime math has the minimum kullback leibler distance to the actual distribution math p math and is thus the closest approximation in the classical information theory information theoretic sense the kullback leibler distance between a second order product approximation and the actual distribution is shown to be math d p parallel p prime sum i x i x j i sum h x i h x 1 x 2 ldots x n math where math i x i x j i math is the mutual information between variable math x i math and its parent math x j i math and math h x 1 x 2 ldots x n math is the joint entropy of variable set math x 1 x 2 ldots x n math since the terms math sum h x i math and math h x 1 x 2 ldots x n math are independent of the dependency ordering in the tree only the sum of the pairwise mutual information s math sum i x i x j i math determines the quality of the approximation thus if every branch edge on the tree is given a weight corresponding to the mutual information between the variables at its vertices then the tree which provides the optimal second order approximation to the target distribution is just the maximum weight tree the equation above also highlights the role of the dependencies in the approximation when no dependencies exist and the first term in the equation is absent we have only an approximation based on first order marginals and the distance between the approximation and the true distribution is due to the redundancies that are not accounted for when the variables are treated as independent as we specify second order dependencies we begin to capture some of that structure and reduce the distance between the two distributions chow and liu provide a simple algorithm for constructing the optimal tree at each stage of the procedure the algorithm simply adds the maximum mutual information pair to the tree see the original paper harvtxt chow liu 1968 for full details a more efficient tree construction algorithm for the common case of sparse data was outlined in harvtxt meil\xc4\x83 1999 chow and wagner proved in a later paper harvtxt chow wagner 1973 that the learning of the chow liu tree is consistent given samples or observations drawn i i d from a tree structured distribution in other words the probability of learning an incorrect tree decays to zero as the number of samples tends to infinity the main idea in the proof is the continuity of the mutual information in the pairwise marginal distribution recently the exponential rate of convergence of the error probability was provided ref name tan a large deviation analysis for the maximum likelihood learning of tree structures v y f tan a anandkumar l tong and a willsky in the international symposium on information theory isit july 2009 ref variations on chow liu trees the obvious problem which occurs when the actual distribution is not in fact a second order dependency tree can still in some cases be addressed by fusing or aggregating together densely connected subsets of variables to obtain a large node chow liu tree harv huang king 2002 or by extending the idea of greedy maximum branch weight selection to non tree multiple parent structures harv williamson 2000 similar techniques of variable substitution and construction are common in the bayes network literature e g for dealing with loops see harvtxt pearl 1988 generalizations of the chow liu tree are the so called t cherry junction trees it is proved that the t cherry junction trees provide a better or at least as good approximation for a discrete

b'knowledge representation and reasoning kr is the field of artificial intelligence ai dedicated to representing information about the world in a form that a computer system can utilize to solve complex tasks such as diagnosing a medical condition or having a dialog in a natural language knowledge representation incorporates findings from psychology citation needed date february 2016 about how humans solve problems and represent knowledge in order to design formalism mathematics formalisms that will make complex systems easier to design and build knowledge representation and reasoning also incorporates findings from logic to automate various kinds of reasoning such as the application of rules or the relations of set theory sets and subset s examples of knowledge representation formalisms include semantic network semantic nets systems architecture frame artificial intelligence frames rules and ontology information science ontologies examples of automated reasoning engines include inference engine s automated theorem proving theorem prover s and classifiers history the earliest work in computerized knowledge representation was focused on general problem solvers such as the general problem solver gps system developed by allen newell and herbert a simon in 1959 these systems featured data structures for planning and decomposition the system would begin with a goal it would then decompose that goal into sub goals and then set out to construct strategies that could accomplish each subgoal in these early days of ai general search algorithms such as a were also developed however the amorphous problem definitions for systems such as gps meant that they worked only for very constrained toy domains e g the blocks world in order to tackle non toy problems ai researchers such as ed feigenbaum and rick hayes roth frederick hayes roth realized that it was necessary to focus systems on more constrained problems it was the failure of these efforts that led to the cognitive revolution in psychology and to the phase of ai focused on knowledge representation that resulted in expert systems in the 1970s and 80s production system computer science production systems frame language s etc rather than general problem solvers ai changed its focus to expert systems that could match human competence on a specific task such as medical diagnosis expert systems gave us the terminology still in use today where ai systems are divided into a knowledge base with facts about the world and rules and an inference engine that applies the rules to the knowledge base in order to answer questions and solve problems in these early systems the knowledge base tended to be a fairly flat structure essentially assertions about the values of variables used by the rules ref cite book last hayes roth first frederick title building expert systems year 1983 publisher addison wesley isbn 0 201 10686 8 author2 donald waterman author3 douglas lenat ref in addition to expert systems other researchers developed the concept of frame language frame based languages in the mid 1980s a frame is similar to an object class it is an abstract description of a category describing things in the world problems and potential solutions frames were originally used on systems geared toward human interaction e g natural language understanding understanding natural language and the social settings in which various default expectations such as ordering food in a restaurant narrow the search space and allow the system to choose appropriate responses to dynamic situations it wasn t long before the frame communities and the rule based researchers realized that there was synergy between their approaches frames were good for representing the real world described as classes subclasses slots data values with various constraints on possible values rules were good for representing and utilizing complex logic such as the process to make a medical diagnosis integrated systems were developed that combined frames and rules one of the most powerful and well known was the 1983 knowledge engineering environment kee from intellicorp software intellicorp kee had a complete rule engine with forward chaining forward and backward chaining it also had a complete frame based knowledge base with triggers slots data values inheritance and message passing although message passing originated in the object oriented community rather than ai it was quickly embraced by ai researchers as well in environments such as kee and in the operating systems for lisp machines

designing computer representations that capture information about the world that can be used to solve complex problems the justification for knowledge representation is that conventional procedural code is not the best formalism to use to solve complex problems knowledge representation makes complex software easier to define and maintain than procedural code and can be used in expert systems for example talking to experts in terms of business rules rather than code lessens the semantic gap between users and developers and makes development of complex systems more practical knowledge representation goes hand in hand with automated reasoning because one of the main purposes of explicitly representing knowledge is to be able to reason about that knowledge to make inferences assert

between expressivity and practicality the ultimate knowledge representation formalism in terms of expressive power and compactness is first order logic fol there is no more powerful formalism than that used by mathematicians to define general propositions about the world however fol has two drawbacks as a knowledge representation formalism ease of use and practicality of implementation first order logic can be intimidating even for many software developers languages which do not have the complete formal power of fol can still provide close to the same expressive power with a user interface that is more practical for the average developer to understand the issue of practicality of implementation is that fol in some ways is too expressive with fol it is possible to create statements e g quantification over infinite sets that would cause a system to never terminate if it attempted to verify them thus a subset of fol can be both easier to use and more practical to implement this was a driving motivation behind rule based expert systems if then rules provide a subset of fol but a very useful one that is also very intuitive the history of most of the early ai

network s were one of the first knowledge representation primitives also data structures and algorithms for general fast search in this area there is a strong overlap with research in data structures and algorithms in computer science in early systems the lisp programming language which was modeled after the lambda calculus was often used as a form of functional knowledge representation frames and rules were the next kind of primitive frame languages had various mechanisms for expressing and enforcing constraints on frame data all data in frames are stored in slots slots are analogous to relations in entity relation modeling and to object properties in object oriented modeling another technique for primitives is to define languages that are modeled after first order logic fol the most well known example is prolog but there are also many special purpose theorem proving environments these environments can validate logical models and can deduce new theories from existing models essentially they automate the process a logician would go through in analyzing a model theorem proving technology had some specific practical applications in the areas of software engineering for example it is possible to prove that a software program rigidly adheres to a formal logical specification meta representation this is also known as the issue of reflection computer programming reflection in computer science it refers to the capability of a formalism to have access to information about its own state an example would be the meta object protocol in smalltalk and clos that gives developers run time access to the class objects and enables them to dynamically redefine the structure of the knowledge base even at run time meta representation means the knowledge representation language is itself expressed in that language for example in most frame based environments all frames would be instances of a frame class that class object can be inspected at run time so that the object can understand and even change its internal structure or the structure of other parts of the model in rule based environments the rules were also usually instances of rule classes part of the meta protocol for rules were the meta rules that prioritized rule firing completeness logic incompleteness traditional logic requires additional axioms and constraints to deal with the real world as opposed to the world of mathematics also it is often useful to associate degrees of confidence with a statement i e not simply say socrates is human but rather socrates is human with confidence 50 this was one of the early innovations from expert system s research which migrated to some commercial tools the ability to associate certainty factors with rules and conclusions later

for early applications of knowledge representation technology they were usually implemented in interpreted environments such as lisp which were slow compared to more traditional platforms of the time ontology engineering main article ontology engineering ontology language in the early years of knowledge based systems the knowledge bases were fairly small the knowledge bases that were meant to actually solve real problems rather than do proof of concept demonstrations needed to focus on well defined problems so for example not just medical diagnosis as a whole topic but medical diagnosis of certain kinds of diseases as knowledge based technology scaled up the need for larger knowledge bases and for modular knowledge bases that could communicate and integrate with each other became apparent this gave rise to the discipline of ontology engineering designing and building large knowledge bases that could be used by multiple projects one of the leading research projects in this area was the cyc project cyc was an attempt to build a huge encyclopedic knowledge base that would contain not just expert knowledge but common sense knowledge in designing an artificial intelligence agent it was soon realized that representing common sense knowledge knowledge that humans simply take for granted was essential to make an ai that could interact with humans using natural language cyc was meant to address this problem the language they defined was known as cycl after cycl a number of ontology language s have been developed most are declarative language s and are either frame language s or are based on first order logic modularity the ability to define boundaries around specific domains and problem spaces is essential for these languages because as stated by tom gruber every ontology is a treaty a social agreement among people with common motive in sharing there are always many competing and differing views that make any general purpose ontology impossible a general purpose ontology would have to be applicable in any domain and different areas of knowledge need to be unified ref russell stuart j norvig peter 2010 artificial intelligence a modern approach 3rd ed upper

of these offers a way to see some part of the world the lumped element model for instance suggests that we think of circuits in terms of components with connections between them with signals flowing instantaneously along the connections this is a useful view but not the only possible one a different ontology arises if we need to attend to the electrodynamics in the device here signals propagate at finite speed and an object like a resistor that was previously viewed as a single component with an i o behavior may now have to be thought of as an extended medium through which an electromagnetic wave flows ontologies can of course be written down in a wide variety of languages and notations e g logic lisp etc the essential information is not the form of that language but the content i e the set of concepts offered as a way of thinking about the world simply put the important part is notions like connections and components not the choice between writing them as predicates or lisp constructs the commitment made selecting one or another ontology can produce a sharply different view of the task at hand consider the difference that arises in selecting the lumped element view of a circuit rather than the electrodynamic view of the same device as a second example medical diagnosis viewed in terms of rules e g mycin looks substantially different from the same task viewed in terms

b'transaction logic is an extension of predicate logic that accounts in a clean and declarative way for the phenomenon of state changes in logic program s and database s this extension adds connectives specifically designed for combining simple actions into complex transactions and for providing control over their execution the logic has a natural model theory and a sound and complete proof theory transaction logic has a horn clause subset which has a procedural as well as a declarative semantics the important features of the logic include hypothetical and committed updates dynamic constraints on transaction execution non determinism and bulk updates in this way transaction logic is able to declaratively capture a number of non logical phenomena including procedural knowledge in

and filing of subjects udc uses arabic numerals arranged decimally every number is thought of as a decimal fraction with the initial decimal point omitted which determines the filing order an advantage of decimal notational systems is that they are infinitely extensible and when new subdivisions are introduced they need not disturb the existing allocation of numbers for ease of reading a

b'enactivism argues that cognition arises through a dynamic interaction between an acting organism and its environment ref name evan thompson it claims that our environment is one which we selectively create through our capacities to interact with the world ref name rowlands organisms do not passively receive information from their environments which they then translate into internal representations natural cognitive systems participate in the generation of meaning engaging in transformational and not merely informational interactions they enact a world ref name jaegher1 these authors suggest that the increasing emphasis upon enactive terminology presages a new era in thinking about cognitive science ref name jaegher1 how the actions involved in enactivism relate to age old questions about free will remains a topic of active debate ref name manetti the term enactivism is close in meaning to enaction defined as the manner in which a subject of perception creatively matches its actions to the requirements of its situation ref name tascano0 the introduction of the term enaction in this context is attributed to francisco varela evan thompson and eleanor rosch ref name tascano0 ref name rwilson who proposed the name to emphasize the growing conviction that cognition is not the representation of a pre given world by a pre given mind but is rather the enactment of a world and a mind on the basis of a history of the variety of actions that a being in the world performs ref name varela this was further developed by thompson and others ref name evan thompson to place emphasis upon the idea that experience of the world is a result of mutual interaction between the sensorimotor capacities of the organism and its environment ref name rwilson the initial emphasis of enactivism upon sensorimotor skills has been criticized as cognitively marginal ref name clarka but it has been extended to apply to higher level cognitive activities such as social interactions ref name jaegher1 in the enactive view knowledge is constructed it is constructed by an agent through its sensorimotor interactions with its environment co constructed between and within living species through their meaningful interaction with each other in its most abstract form knowledge is co constructed between human individuals in socio linguistic interactions science is a particular form of social knowledge construction that allows us to perceive and predict events beyond our immediate cognitive grasp and also to construct further even more powerful scientific knowledge ref name rohde enactivism is closely related to situated cognition and embodied cognition and is presented as an alternative to cognitivism psychology cognitivism computationalism and cartesian dualism philosophical aspects enaction philosophy redirects here enactivism is one of a cluster of related theories sometimes known as the 4es as described by mark rowlands mental processes are ref name rowlands embodied involving more than the brain including a more general involvement of bodily structures and processes embedded functioning only in a related external environment enacted involving not only neural processes but also things an organism does extended into the organism s environment enactivism proposes an alternative to dualism philosophy of mind dualism as a philosophy of mind in that it emphasises the interactions between mind body and the environment seeing them all as inseparably intertwined in mental processes ref name ethompson the self arises as part of the process of an embodied entity interacting with the environment in precise ways determined by its physiology in this sense individuals can be seen to grow into or arise from their interactive role with the world ref name burman enaction is the idea that organisms create their own experience through their actions organisms are not passive receivers of input from the environment but are actors in the environment such that what they experience is shaped by how they act ref name hutchins in the tree of knowledge maturana varela proposed the term enactive ref name maturana to evoke the view of knowledge that what is known is brought forth in contraposition to the more classical views of either cognitivism ref group note name cognitivism or connectionism ref group note name connectionism they see enactivism as providing a middle ground between the two extremes of representationalism and solipsism they seek to confront the problem of understanding how our existence the praxis process praxis of our living is coupled to a surrounding world which appears filled with regularities that are at every instant the result of our biological and social histories to find a via media to understand the regularity of the world we are experiencing at every moment but without any point of reference independent of ourselves that would give certainty to our descriptions and cognitive assertions indeed the whole mechanism of generating ourselves as describers and observers tells us that our world as the world which we bring forth in our coexistence with others will always have precisely that mixture of regularity and mutability that combination of solidity and shifting sand so typical of human experience when we look at it up close tree of knowledge p nbsp 241 enactivism also addresses the hard problem of consciousness referred to by thompson as part of the explanatory gap in explaining how consciousness and subjective experience are related to brain and body ref name ethompson2 the problem with the dualistic concepts of consciousness and life in standard formulations of the hard problem is that they exclude each other by construction ref name ethompson3 instead according to thompson s view of enactivism the study of consciousness or phenomenology philosophy phenomenology as exemplified by husserl and merleau ponty is to complement science and its objectification of the world the whole universe of science is built upon the world as directly experienced and if we want to subject science itself to rigorous scrutiny and arrive at a precise assessment of its meaning and scope we must begin by reawakening the basic experience of the world of which science is the second order expression merleau ponty the phenomenology of perception as quoted by thompson p nbsp 165 in this interpretation enactivism asserts that science is formed or enacted as part of humankind s interactivity with its world and by embracing phenomenology science itself is properly situated in relation to the rest of human life and is thereby secured on a sounder footing ref name ethompson4 ref name baldwin enaction has been seen as a move to conjoin representationalism with phenomenalism that is as adopting a constructivist epistemology an epistemology centered upon the active participation of the subject in constructing reality ref name mutelesi ref name chiari however constructivism focuses upon more than a simple interactivity that could be described as a minor adjustment to assimilate reality or accommodate to it ref name glaserfeld constructivism looks upon interactivity as a radical creative revisionist process in which the knower constructs a personal knowledge system based upon their experience and tested by its viability in practical encounters with their environment learning is a result of perceived anomalies that produce dissatisfaction with existing conceptions ref name glasersfeld2 how does constructivism relate to enactivism from the above remarks it can be seen that ernst von glasersfeld glasersfeld expresses an interactivity between the knower and the known quite acceptable to an enactivist but does not emphasize the structured probing of the environment by the knower that leads to the perturbation relative to some expected result that then leads to a new understanding ref name glasersfeld2 it is this probing activity especially where it is not accidental but deliberate that characterizes enaction and invokes affect ref name ward2 that is the motivation and planning that lead to doing and to fashioning the probing both observing and modifying the environment so that perceptions and nature condition one another through generating one another ref name diettrich the questioning nature of this probing activity is not an emphasis of jean piaget piaget and glasersfeld sharing enactivism s stress upon both action and embodiment in the incorporation of knowledge but giving glasersfeld s mechanism of viability an introduction to evolution evolutionary emphasis ref name diettrich2 is evolutionary epistemology inasmuch as an organism must reflect its environment well enough for the organism to be able to survive in it and to be competitive enough to be able to reproduce at sustainable rate the structure and reflexes of the organism itself embody knowledge of its environment this biology inspired theory of the growth of knowledge is closely tied to universal darwinism and is associated with evolutionary epistemologists such as karl popper donald t campbell peter munz and gary cziko ref name gontier according to munz an organism is an embodied theory about its environment embodied theories are also no longer expressed in language but in anatomical structures or reflex responses etc ref name gontier ref name munz psychological aspects mcgann others ref name mcgann cite journal author1 marek mcgann author2 hanne de jaegher author3 ezequiel di paolo year 2013 title

volumetricity by appealing to patterns of sensorimotor expectations these arise from our agent active movements and interaction with objects or object active changes in the object itself the solidity is perceived through our expectations and skills in knowing how the object s appearance would change with changes in how we relate to it he saw all perception as an active exploration of the world rather than being a passive process something which happens to us no\xc3\xab s idea of the role of expectations in three dimensional perception has been opposed by several philosophers notably by andy clark ref name clarka1 clark points to difficulties of the enactive approach he points to internal processing of visual signals for example in the ventral and dorsal pathways two streams hypothesis the two streams hypothesis this results in an integrated perception of objects their recognition and location respectively yet this processing cannot be described as an action or actions in a more general criticism clark suggests that perception is not a matter of expectations about sensorimotor mechanisms guiding perception rather although the limitations of sensorimotor mechanisms constrain perception this sensorimotor activity is drastically filtered to fit current needs and purposes of the organism and it is these imposed expectations that govern perception filtering for the relevant details of sensorimotor input called sensorimotor summarizing ref name clarka1 another application of enaction to perception is analysis of the human hand the many remarkably demanding uses of the

b'file enactive human machine interface png thumb 300px enactive human machine interface translating the aspects of a knowledge base into modalities of perception for a human operator the auditory visual and tactile presentations by the system respond to tactile input from the operator which user input in turn depends upon the auditory visual and tactile feedback from the system ref name bordegoni ref name fukuda enactive interfaces are interactive systems that allow organization and transmission of knowledge obtained through action examples are interfaces that couple a human with a machine to do things usually done unaided such as shaping a three dimensional object using multiple modality interactions with a data base ref name fukuda or using interactive video to allow a student to visually engage with mathematics concepts ref name held enactive interface design can be approached through the idea of raising awareness of affordances that is optimization of the awareness of possible actions available to someone using the enactive interface ref name stoffregen this optimization involves visibility affordance and feedback ref name stone ref name zudilova the enactive interface in the figure interprets manual input and provides a response in perceptual terms in the form of images sounds and haptic tactile feedback the system is called enactive because of the feedback loop in which the system response is decided by the user input and the user input is driven by the perceived system responses ref name bordegoni enactive interfaces are new types of human computer interaction human computer interface that express and transmit the enactive knowledge by integrating different sensory aspects the driving concept of enactive interfaces is then the fundamental role of motor action for storing and acquiring knowledge action driven interfaces enactive interfaces are then capable of conveying and understanding gestures of the user in order to provide an adequate response in perceptual terms enactive interfaces can be considered a new step in the development of the human computer interaction because they are characterized by a closed loop between the natural gestures of the user efferent component of the system and the perceptual modalities activated afferent component enactive interfaces can be conceived to exploit this direct loop and the capability of recognizing complex gestures the development of such interfaces requires the creation of a common vision between different research areas like computer vision haptic perception haptic and sound processing giving more attention on the motor action aspect of interaction an example of prototypical systems that are able to introduce enactive interfaces are reactive robots robots that are always in contact with the human hand like current play console controllers wii remote and are capable of interpreting the human movements and guiding the human for the completion of a manipulation task enactive knowledge enactive knowledge is information gained through perception action interaction in the environment in many aspects the enactive knowledge is more natural than the other forms both in terms of the learning process and in the way it is applied in the world such knowledge is inherently multimodal interaction multimodal because it requires the co ordination of the various senses two key characteristics of enactive knowledge are that it is experential it relates to doing and depends on the user s experience and it is cultural the way of doing is itself dependent upon social aspects attitudes values practices and legacy ref name bordegoni enactive interfaces are related to a fundamental interaction concept that often is not exploited by existing human computer interaction human computer interface technologies as stated by cognitive psychologist jerome bruner the traditional interaction with the information mediated by a computer is mostly based on symbolic or iconic knowledge and not on enactive knowledge ref name slee while in the symbolic way of learning knowledge is stored as words mathematical symbols or other symbol systems in the iconic stage knowledge is stored in the form of visual images such as diagrams and illustrations that can accompany verbal information on the other hand enactive knowledge is a form of knowledge based on active participation knowing by doing by living rather than thinking ref name slee2 any domain of knowledge or any problem within that domain of knowledge can be represented in three ways by a set of actions appropriate for achieving a certain result enactive representation by a set of summary images or graphics that stand for a concept without defining it fully iconic representation and by a set of symbolic or logical propositions drawn from a symbolic system that is governed by rules or laws for forming and transforming propositions symbolic representation ref name bruner a particular form of knowledge is a skill juggling being a simple example and the acquisition of a skill is one area where enactive knowledge is evident the sensorimotor and cognitive activities involved in acquiring skills are tabulated by the skills fp6 european skills project ref name bardy cite journal title an enactive approach to perception action and skill acquisition in virtual reality environments author1

technological development network of excellence a european consortium of more than 20 research laboratories that are joining their research effort for the definition development and exploitation of enactive interfaces enactive network of excellence the research on enactive knowledge and enactive interfaces is the objective of the enactive network of excellence a network of excellence is a

enactive noe started in 2004 with more than 20 partners with the objective of the creation of a multidisciplinary research community with the aim of structuring the research on a new generation of human computer interfaces called enactive interfaces the aim of this noe is not only the research on enactive interfaces by itself but also the integration of the partners through a virtual laboratory and the spreading of the expertise and knowledge of the network since 2004 the partners coordinated by the percro laboratory have improved both the theoretical aspects of enaction through seminars and

barriers to interoperability which is a basic assumption of this research they are not aimed at structuring interoperability knowledge with respect to their ability to remove various barriers the enterprise interoperability framework has three basic dimensions interoperability concerns defined the content or aspect of interoperation that may take place at various levels of the business

solve their interoperability problems when carrying out an interoperability project involving two particular enterprises interoperability concerns and interoperability barriers between the two enterprises will be identified first and mapped to this enterprise interoperability framework using the enterprise architecture framework framework existing interoperability degree can be characterised and targeted interoperability degree can be defined as the goal objective to meet then knowledge solutions associated to the barriers and concerns can be searched in the framework and solutions found will be proposed to users for possible adaptation and or combination with other solutions to remove the identified barriers so that the required interoperability can be established

b'in a mathematical logic formal system of logic used for knowledge representation the open world assumption is the assumption that the truth value of a statement logic statement may be true irrespective of whether or not it is known to be true it is the opposite of the closed world assumption which holds that any statement that is true is also known to be true the open world assumption owa codifies the informal notion that in general no single agent or observer has complete knowledge and therefore cannot make the closed world assumption the owa limits the kinds of inference and deductions an agent can make to those that follow from statements that are known to the agent to be true in contrast the closed world assumption allows an agent to infer from its lack of knowledge of a statement being true anything that logical consequence follows from that statement being false heuristically the open world assumption applies when we represent knowledge within a system as we discover it and where we cannot guarantee that we have discovered or will discover complete information in the owa statements about knowledge that are not included in or inferred from the knowledge explicitly recorded in the system may be considered unknown rather than wrong or false semantic web languages such as web ontology language owl make the open world assumption the absence of a particular statement within the web means in principle that the statement has not been made explicitly yet irrespective of whether it would be true or not and irrespective of whether we believe that it would be true or not in essence from the absence of a statement alone a deductive reasoner cannot and must not infer that the statement is false many procedural programming language s and database s make the closed world assumption for example if a typical airline database does not contain a seat assignment for a traveler it is assumed that the traveler has not checked in the closed world assumption typically applies when a system has complete control over information this is the case with many database applications where the database transaction system acts as a central broker and arbiter of concurrent requests by multiple independent clients e g airline booking agents there are however many databases with incomplete information for example one cannot assume that because there is no mention on a patient s history of a particular allergy that the patient does not suffer from that allergy example statement mary is a citizen of france question is paul a citizen of france closed world for example sql answer no open world answer unknown under owa failure to derive a fact does not imply the opposite for example assume we only know that mary is a citizen of france from this information we can neither conclude that paul is not a citizen of france nor that he is therefore we admit the fact that our knowledge of the world is incomplete the open world assumption is closely related to the monotonicity of entailment monotonic nature of first order logic adding new information never falsifies a previous conclusion namely if we subsequently learn that paul is also a citizen of france this does not change any earlier positive or negative conclusions the language of logic programs with stable model semantics strong negation strong negation allows us to postulate the closed world assumption for some predicates and leave the other predicates in the realm of the open world assumption see also closed world assumption references cite book last1 russell first1 stuart j authorlink1 stuart j russell last2 norvig first2 peter authorlink2 peter norvig title artificial intelligence a modern approach year 2010 publisher prentice hall location upper saddle river isbn 9780136042594 url http www pearsonhighered com educator product artificial intelligence a modern approach 9780136042594 page edition 3rd defaultsort open world assumption category logic programming category knowledge representation'
b'more footnotes date august 2011 the closed world assumption cwa in a mathematical logic formal system of logic used for knowledge representation is the presumption that a statement that is true is also known to be true therefore conversely what is not currently known to be true is false the same name also refers to a formal logic logical formalization of this assumption by raymond reiter the opposite of the closed world assumption is the open world assumption owa stating that lack of knowledge does not imply falsity decisions on cwa vs owa determine the understanding of the actual semantics of a conceptual expression with the same notations of concepts a successful formalization of natural language semantics usually cannot avoid an explicit revelation of whether the implicit logical backgrounds are based on cwa or owa negation as failure is related to the closed world assumption as it amounts to believing false every predicate that cannot be proved to be true example in the context of knowledge management the closed world assumption is used in at least two situations 1 when the knowledge base is known to be complete e g a corporate database containing records for every employee and 2 when the knowledge base is known to be incomplete but a best definite answer must be derived from incomplete information for example if a database contains the following table reporting editors who have worked on a given article a query on the people not having edited the article on formal logic is usually expected to return sarah johnson border 1 cellspacing 0 cellpadding 2 align center colspan 2 style background ffdead edit style background efefef editor style background efefef article john doe formal logic joshua a norton formal logic sarah johnson introduction to spatial databases charles ponzi formal logic emma lee choon formal logic br the preceding tag creates a whitespace line separating the table above from the text paragraph below in the closed world assumption the table is assumed to be complete knowledge base complete it lists all editor article relationships and sarah johnson is the only editor who has not edited the article on formal logic in contrast with the open world assumption the table is not assumed to contain all editor article tuples and the answer to who has not edited the formal logic article is unknown there is an unknown number of editors not listed in the table and an unknown number of articles edited by sarah johnson that are also not listed in the table formalization in logic the first formalization of the closed world assumption in logic formal logic consists in adding to the knowledge base the negation of the literals that are not currently logical consequence entailed by it the result of this addition is always consistent if the knowledge base is in horn clause horn form but is not guaranteed to be consistent otherwise for example the knowledge base math english fred vee irish fred math entails neither math english fred math nor math irish fred math adding the negation of these two literals to the knowledge base leads to math english fred vee irish fred neg english fred neg irish fred math which is inconsistent in other words this formalization of the closed world assumption sometimes turns a consistent knowledge base into an inconsistent one the closed world assumption does not introduce an inconsistency on a knowledge base math k math exactly when the intersection of all herbrand model s of math k math is also a model of math k math in the propositional case this condition is equivalent to math k math having a single minimal model where a model is minimal if no other model has a subset of variables assigned to true alternative formalizations not suffering from this problem have been proposed in the following description the considered knowledge base math k math is assumed to be propositional in all cases the formalization of the closed world assumption is based on adding to math k math the negation of the formulae that are free for negation for math k math i e the formulae that can be assumed to be false in other words the closed world assumption applied to a propositional formula math k math generates the formula math k wedge neg f f in f math the set math f math of formulae that are free for negation in math k math can be defined in different ways leading to different formalizations of the closed world assumption the following are the definitions of math f math being free for negation in the various formalizations cwa closed world assumption math f math is a positive literal not entailed by math k math gcwa generalized cwa math f math is a positive literal such that for every positive clause math c math such that math k not vdash c math it holds math k not vdash c vee f math ref citation first jack last minker author link jack minker title on indefinite databases and the closed world assumption publisher springer berlin heidelberg

b'a deductive classifier is a type of artificial intelligence inference engine it takes as input a set of declarations in a frame language about a domain such as medical research or molecular biology for example the names of class hierarchy classes sub classes properties and restrictions on allowable values the classifier determines if the various declarations are logically consistent and if not will highlight the specific inconsistent declarations and the inconsistencies among them if the declarations are consistent the classifier can then assert additional information based on the input for example it can add information about existing classes create additional classes etc this differs from traditional inference engines that trigger off of if then conditions in rules classifiers are also similar to automated theorem proving theorem provers in that they take as input and produce output via first order logic classifiers originated with kl one frame language s they are increasingly significant now that they form a part in the enabling technology of the semantic web modern classifiers leverage the web ontology language the models they analyze and generate are called ontologies

volume 284 pages 34 43 ref history a classic problem in knowledge representation for artificial intelligence is the trade off between the expressive power and the computational efficiency of the knowledge representation system the most powerful form of knowledge representation is first order logic fol however it is not possible to implement knowledge representation that provides the complete expressive power of first order logic such a representation will include the capability to represent concepts such as the set of all integers which are impossible to iterate through implementing an assertion quantified for an infinite set by definition results in an undecidable non terminating program however the problem is deeper than not being able to implement infinite sets as levesque demonstrated the closer a knowledge representation mechanism comes to fol the more likely it is to result in expressions that require infinite or unacceptably large resources to compute ref cite book

kr system should do the bad new is that it is also clear that the services can not be provided deciding whether or not a sentence in fol is a theorem is unsolvable ref as a result of this trade off a great deal of early work on knowledge representation for artificial intelligence involved experimenting with various compromises that provide a subset of fol with acceptable computation speeds one of the first and most successful compromises was to develop languages based predominately on modus ponens i e if then rules rule based systems were the predominate knowledge representation mechanism for virtually all early expert systems rule based systems provided acceptable computational efficiency while still providing powerful knowledge representation also rules were highly intuitive to knowledge

however after the early success of rule based systems there arose more pervasive use of frame languages instead of or more often combined with rules frames provided a more natural way to represent certain types of concepts especially concepts in subpart or subclass hierarchies this led to development of a new kind of inference engine known as a classifier a classifier could analyze a class hierarchy also known as an ontology computer science ontology and determine if it was valid if the hierarchy was invalid the classifier would highlight the inconsistent declarations for a language to

b'frames were proposed by marvin minsky in his 1974 article a framework for representing knowledge a frame is an artificial intelligence data structure used to divide knowledge into substructures by representing stereotype d situations frames are the primary data structure used in artificial intelligence frame language s frames are also an extensive part of knowledge representation and reasoning schemes frames were originally derived from semantic networks and are therefore part of structure based knowledge representations according to russell and norvig s artificial intelligence a modern approach structural representations assemble facts about particular object and even types and arrange the types into a large taxonomic hierarchy analogous to a biological taxonomy frame structure the frame contains information on how to use the frame what to expect next and what to do when these expectations are not met some information in the frame is generally unchanged while other information stored in terminals clarify date january 2010 reason which type of terminal is meant usually change different frames may share the same terminals each piece of information about a particular frame is held in a slot the information can contain facts or data values called facets procedures also called procedural attachments if needed deferred evaluation if added updates linked information default values for data for procedures other frames or subframes features and advantages a frame s terminals are already filled with default values which is based on how the human mind works for example when a person is told a boy kicks a ball most people will visualize a particular ball such as a familiar soccer ball rather than imagining some abstract ball with no attributes one particular strength of frame based knowledge representations is that unlike semantic networks they allow for exceptions in particular instances this gives frames an amount of flexibility that allow representations of real world phenomena to be reflected more accurately like semantic networks frames can be queried using spreading activation following the rules of inheritance any value given to a slot that is inherited by subframes will be updated if added to the corresponding slots in the subframes and any new instances of a particular frame will feature that new value as the default because frames are structurally based it is possible to generate a semantic network given a set of frames even though it lacks explicit arcs the reference to minsky s teacher noam chomsky and his generative grammar of 1950 is generally missing in minsky s publications however the semantic strength is originated by that concept the simplified structures of frames allow for easy analogical reasoning a much prized feature in any intelligent agent the procedural attachments provided by frames also allow a degree of flexibility that makes for a more realistic representation and gives a natural affordance for programming applications example worth noticing here is the easy analogical reasoning comparison that can be done between a boy and a monkey just by having similarly named slots also notice that alex an instance of a boy inherits default values like sex from the more general parent object boy but the boy may also have different instance values in the form of exceptions such as the number of legs class wikitable slot value type alex this frame name alex key value isa boy parent frame sex male inheritance value age if needed subtract current birthdate procedural attachment home 100 main st instance value birthdate 8 4 2000 instance value favorite food spaghetti instance value climbs trees instance value body type wiry instance value num legs 1 exception class wikitable slot value type boy this frame isa person parent frame sex male instance value age under 12 yrs procedural attachment sets constraint home a place frame num legs default 2 default inherited from person frame class wikitable slot value type monkey this frame isa primate parent frame sex oneof male female procedural attachment age an integer procedural attachment sets constraint habitat default jungle default favorite food default bananas default climbs trees body type default wiry default num legs default 2 default see also frame language frame problem references russell stuart j norvig peter 2010 artificial intelligence a modern approach 2nd ed upper saddle river new jersey prentice hall isbn 0 13 604259 7 http aima cs berkeley edu chpt 1 external links http web media mit edu minsky papers frames frames html minsky s a framework for representing knowledge http aima cs berkeley edu artificial intelligence a modern approach website category knowledge representation category history of artificial intelligence'

b'file argument map png thumb a schematic argument map showing a contention or conclusion supporting arguments and objections and an inference objection in informal logic and philosophy an argument map or argument diagram is a visual representation of the structure of an argument an argument map typically includes the key components of the argument traditionally called the logical consequence conclusion and the premise s also called main contention contention and reason argument reason s ref harvnb freeman 1991 pp 49 90 ref argument maps can also show co premise s objection argument objection s counterargument s rebuttal s and lemma logic lemma s there are different styles of argument map but they are often functionally equivalent and represent an argument s individual claims and the relationships between them argument maps are commonly used in the context of teaching and applying critical thinking ref for example harvnb davies 2012 harvnb facione 2013 p 86 harvnb fisher 2004 harvnb kelley 2014 p 73 harvnb kunsch schnarr van tyle 2014 harvnb walton 2013 p 10 ref the purpose of mapping is to uncover the logical structure of arguments identify unstated assumptions evaluate

standard diagram ref name reedrowe64 harvnb reed rowe 2007 p 64 ref consists of a tree structure with each of the reasons leading to the conclusion there is no consensus as to whether the conclusion should be at the top of the tree with the reasons leading up to it or whether it should be at the bottom with the reasons leading down to it ref name reedrowe64 another variation diagrams an argument from left to right ref for example harvnb walton 2013 pp 18 20 ref according to doug walton and colleagues an argument map has two basic components one component is a set of circled numbers arrayed as points each number represents a proposition premise or conclusion in the argument being diagrammed the other component is a set of lines or arrows joining the points each line arrow represents an inference the whole network of points and lines represents a kind of overview of the reasoning in the given argument ref harvnb reed walton macagno 2007 p 2 ref with the introduction of software for producing argument maps it has become common for argument maps to consist of boxes containing the actual propositions rather than numbers referencing those propositions there is disagreement on the terminology to be used when describing argument maps ref harvnb freeman 1991 pp 49 90 harvnb reed rowe 2007 ref but the standard diagram contains the following structures dependent premises or co premises where at least one of the joined premises requires another premise before it can give support to the conclusion an argument with this structure has been called a linked argument ref harvnb harrell 2010 p 19 ref file dependent premises jpg thumb centre 100px statements 1 and 2 are dependent premises or co premises independent premises where the premise can support the conclusion on its own although independent premises may jointly make the conclusion more convincing this is to be distinguished from situations where a premise gives no support unless it is joined to another premise where several premises or groups of premises lead to a final conclusion the argument might be described as convergent this is distinguished from a divergent argument where a single premise might be used to support two separate conclusions ref harvnb freeman 1991 pp 91 110 harvnb harrell 2010 p 20 ref file independent premises jpg thumb centre 150px statements 2 3 4 are independent premises intermediate conclusions or sub conclusions where a claim is supported by another claim that is used in turn to support some further claim i e the final conclusion or another intermediate conclusion in the following diagram statement 4 is an intermediate conclusion in that it is a conclusion in relation to statement 5 but is a premise in relation to the final conclusion i e statement 1 an argument with this structure is sometimes called a complex argument if there is a single chain of claims containing at least one intermediate conclusion the argument is sometimes described as a serial argument or a chain argument ref harvnb beardsley 1950 pp 18 19 harvnb reed walton macagno 2007 pp 3 8 harvnb harrell 2010 pp 19 21 ref file intermediate conclusion jpg thumb centre 150px statement 4 is an intermediate conclusion or sub conclusion each of these structures can be represented by the equivalent box and line approach to argument maps in the following diagram the contention is shown at the top and the boxes linked to it represent supporting reasons which comprise one or more premises the green arrow indicates that the two reasons support the contention file a box and line diagram

and implied premises this is optional depending on the purpose of the argument map put the statements into boxes and draw a line between any boxes that are linked indicate support from premise s to sub conclusion with arrows argument maps are useful not only for representing and analyzing existing writings but also for thinking through issues as part of a problem structuring methods problem structuring process or writing process the use of such argument analysis for thinking through issues has been called reflective argumentation ref for example harvnb hoffmann borenstein 2013 harvnb

the suggestion that many students probably will find it a very clear and convenient mode of exhibiting the logical analysis of the course of argument to draw it out in the form of a tree or logical division however the technique did not become widely used possibly because for complex arguments it involved much writing and rewriting of the premises file wigmore chart png thumb wigmore evidence

the beardsley approach to diagramming arguments along with its later developments became the standard approach in this field toulmin introduced something that was missing from beardsley s approach in beardsley arrows link reasons and conclusions but no support is given to the implication itself between them there is no theory in other words of inference distinguished from logical deduction the passage is always deemed not controversial and not subject to support and evaluation ref harvnb reed walton macagno 2007 p 8 ref toulmin introduced the concept of warrant which can be considered as representing the reasons behind the inference the backing that authorizes the link ref harvnb reed walton macagno 2007 p 9 ref beardsley s approach was refined by stephen n thomas whose 1973 book

conclusion ref name snoeckhenkemans harvnb snoeck henkemans 2000 p 453 ref however the actual distinction between dependent and independent premises had been made prior to this ref name snoeckhenkemans the introduction of the linked structure made it possible for argument maps to represent missing or hidden premises in addition thomas suggested showing reasons both for and against a conclusion with the reasons against being represented by dotted arrows thomas introduced the term argument diagram and defined basic reasons as those that were not supported by any others in the argument and the final conclusion as that which was not used to support any further conclusion file scrivendiag png thumb scriven s argument diagram the explicit premise 1 is conjoined with additional

intelligence analysis and public debates ref name applications logical structure argument maps display an argument s logical structure more clearly than does the standard linear way of presenting arguments critical thinking concepts in learning to argument map students master such key critical thinking concepts as reason objection premise conclusion inference rebuttal unstated assumption co premise strength of evidence logical structure independent evidence etc mastering such concepts is not just a matter of memorizing their definitions or even being able to apply them correctly it is also understanding why the distinctions these words mark are important and using that understanding to guide one s reasoning visualization humans are highly visual and argument mapping may provide students with a basic set of visual schemas with which to understand argument structures more careful reading and listening learning to argument map teaches people to read and listen more carefully and highlights for them the key questions what is the logical structure of this argument and how does this sentence fit into the larger structure in depth cognitive processing is thus more likely more careful writing and speaking argument mapping helps people to state their reasoning and evidence more precisely because the reasoning and evidence must fit explicitly into the map s logical structure literal and intended meaning often many statements in an argument do not precisely assert what the author meant learning to argument map enhances the complex skill of distinguishing literal from intended meaning externalization writing something down and reviewing what one has written often helps reveal gaps and clarify one s thinking because the logical structure of argument maps is clearer than that of linear prose the benefits of mapping will exceed those of ordinary writing anticipating replies important to critical thinking is anticipating objections and considering the plausibility of different rebuttals mapping develops this anticipation skill and so improves analysis standards argument interchange format the argument interchange format aif is an international effort to develop

b'issue based information system ibis was invented by werner kunz and horst rittel as an argumentation based approach to tackling wicked problem s ndash complex ill defined problems that involve multiple stakeholder corporate stakeholders ref werner kunz and rittel horst issues as elements of information systems working paper no 131 studiengruppe f\xc3\xbcr systemforschung heidelberg germany july 1970 reprinted may 1979 ref to quote from their original paper issue based information systems ibis are meant to support coordination and planning of political decision processes ibis guides the identification structuring and settling of issues raised by problem solving groups and provides information pertinent to the discourse subsequently the understanding of planning and design as a process of argumentation of the designer with himself or with others has led to the use of ibis as a design rationale ref noble douglas and rittel horst w j 1988 issue based information systems for design proceedings of the acadia 88 conference association for computer aided design in architecture university of michigan october 1988 also published as working paper 492 institute of urban and regional development college of environmental design university of california berkeley november 1988 ref the basic structure of ibis is a graph discrete mathematics graph it is therefore quite suitable to be manipulated by computer overview the elements of ibis are issues or questions that need to be answered each of which are associated with alternative positions or possible answers these in turn are associated with arguments which support or object to a given position or another argument in the course of the treatment of issues new issues come up which are treated likewise issue based information systems are used as a means of widening the coverage of a problem by encouraging a greater degree of participation particularly in the earlier phases of the process the designer is increasing the opportunity that difficulties of his proposed solution unseen by him will be discovered by others since the problem observed by a designer can always be treated as merely a symptom of another higher level problem the argumentative approach also increases the likelihood that someone will attempt to attack the problem from this point of view another desirable characteristic of the issue based information system is that it helps to make the design process transparent transparency here refers to the ability of observers as well as participants to trace back the process of decision making ibis is used in issue mapping ref okada a shum s j b and sherborne t eds knowledge cartography software tools and mapping techniques springer 2008 isbn 978 1 84800 148 0 ref an argument visualization technique related to argument mapping it is also the basis of a facilitation technique called dialogue mapping ref conklin j dialog mapping reflections on an industrial strength case study in visualizing argumentation tools for collaborative and educational sense making p kirschner s j b shum c s carr eds springer verlag london 2003 ref history rittel s interest lay in the

vol 4 elsevier scientific publishing company inc amsterdam 1973 reprinted in n cross ed developments in design methodology j wiley sons chichester 1984 pp 135 144 ref so it is no surprise that rittel and kunz envisaged ibis as the type of information system meant to support the work of cooperatives like governmental or administrative agencies or committees planning groups etc that are confronted with a problem complex in order to arrive at a plan for decision ref werner kunz and rittel horst issues as elements of information systems working paper no 131 studiengruppe f\xc3\xbcr systemforschung heidelberg germany july 1970 reprinted may 1979 ref when the paper was written there were three manual paper based ibis type systems in use two in government agencies and one in a university a renewed interest in ibis type systems came about in the following decade when advances in technology made it possible to design relatively inexpensive computer based ibis type systems jeff conklin and co workers adapted the ibis structure for use in software engineering creating the gibis graphical ibis hypertext system in the late 1980s ref conklin j and begeman m l gibis a hypertext tool for team design deliberation proceedings of the acm conference on hypertext 1987 ref several other graphical ibis type systems were developed once it was realised that such systems facilitated collaborative design and problem solving ref shum s j b selvin albert m sierhuis m conklin j haley c b and nuseibeh b hypermedia support for argumentation based rationale 15 years on from gibis and qoc rationale management in software engineering springer 2006 ref these efforts culminated in the creation of the open source compendium software tool which supports among other things a graphical ibis notation similar tools which do not rely on a database for storage include dred ref http www3 imperial ac uk designengineering tools dred ref and designvue ref http www3 imperial ac uk portal page portallive designengineering tools designvue ref in recent years there has been a renewed interest in ibis type systems particularly in the context of sensemaking and collaborative problem solving in a variety of social and technical contexts of particular note is facilitation method called dialogue mapping which uses the ibis notation to map out a design or any other dialogue as it evolves ref conklin jeff dialogue mapping building shared understanding of wicked problems wiley 1st edition 18 november 2005 isbn 978 0 470 01768 5 ref lately online versions of dialogue and issue

the meaning of a synset is further clarified with a short defining gloss and one or more usage examples an example adjective synset is good right ripe most suitable or right for a particular purpose a good time to plant tomatoes the right time to act the time is ripe for great sociological changes all synsets are connected to other synsets by means of semantic relations these relations which are not all shared by all lexical categories include noun s hypernym s y is a hypernym of x if every x is a kind of y canine is a hypernym of dog hyponym s y is a hyponym of x if every y is a kind of x

level all are linked to a unique beginner synset entity noun hierarchies are far deeper than verb hierarchies adjectives are not organized into hierarchical trees instead two central antonyms such as hot and cold form binary poles while satellite synonyms such as steaming and chilly connect to their respective poles via a similarity relations the adjectives can be visualized in this way as dumbbells rather than as trees psycholinguistic aspects of wordnet the initial goal of the wordnet project was to build a lexical database that would be consistent with theories of human semantic memory developed in the late 1960s psychological experiments indicated that speakers organized their knowledge of concepts in an economic hierarchical fashion retrieval time required to access conceptual knowledge seemed to be directly related to the number of hierarchies the speaker needed to traverse to access the knowledge thus speakers could more quickly verify that canaries can sing because a canary is a songbird sing is a property stored on the same level as canary but required slightly more time to verify that canaries can fly where they had to access the concept bird on the superordinate level and even more time to verify canaries have skin requiring look up across multiple levels of hyponymy up to animal ref collins a quillian m r 1972 experiments on semantic memory and

wordnet s central adjectives in the dumbbell structure are found to co occur far more frequently than chance a fact that has been found to hold for many languages wordnet as a lexical ontology wordnet is sometimes called an ontology a persistent claim that its creators do not make the hypernym hyponym relationships among the noun synsets can be interpreted as specialization relations among conceptual categories in other words wordnet can be interpreted and used as a lexical ontology computer science ontology in the computer science sense however such an ontology should normally be corrected before being used since it contains hundreds of basic semantic inconsistencies such as i the existence of common specializations for exclusive categories and ii redundancies in the specialization hierarchy furthermore transforming wordnet into a lexical ontology usable for knowledge representation should normally also involve i nbsp distinguishing the specialization relations into subtypeof and instanceof relations and ii nbsp associating intuitive unique identifiers to each category although such corrections and transformations have been performed and documented as part

b'the information coding classification icc is a classification system covering almost all extant 6500 knowledge fields knowledge domain s its conceptualization goes beyond the scope of the well known library classification systems such as dewey decimal classification dcc universal decimal classification udc and library of congress classification lcc by extending also to knowledge system s that so far have not afforded to classify literature icc actually presents a flexible universal ordering system for both literature and other kinds of information set out as knowledge fields from a methodological point of view icc differs from the above mentioned systems along the following three lines its main classes are not based on discipline s but on nine live stages of development so called ontic al levels it breaks them roughly down into hierarchical steps by further nine categorization categories which makes decimal number coding possible the contents of a knowledge field is earmarked via a digital position scheme which makes the first hierarchical step refer to the nine ontical levels object areas as subject categories and the second hierarchical step refer to nine functionally ordered form categories respective knowledge fields permit to step down by the same principle to a third and forth level and even further to a fifth and sixth level finally knowledge field subdivisions will have to conform to said digital position scheme hence for a given knowledge field identical codes will mark identical categories under respective numbers of the coding system this mnemotechnics mnemotechnical aspect of the system helps memorizing and straightaway retrieving the whereabouts of respective interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary fields the first two hierarchical levels may be regarded as a top or upper ontology for ontologies and other applications the terms of the first three hierarchical levels were set out in german and english in

b'distinguish2 the same term used in model theory a branch of mathematical logic refimprove date may 2008 a mathematical model is a description of a system using mathematics mathematical concepts and language of mathematics language the process of developing a mathematical model is termed mathematical modeling mathematical models are used in the natural science s such as physics biology earth science meteorology and engineering disciplines such as computer science artificial intelligence as well as in the social sciences such as economics psychology sociology political science physicist s engineer s statistician s operations research analysts and economist s use mathematical models most extensively a model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components and to make predictions about behaviour elements of a mathematical model mathematical models can take many forms including dynamical systems statistical model s differential equations or game theory game theoretic models these and other types of models can overlap with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures in general mathematical models may include model theory logical models in many cases the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical models developed on the theoretical side agree with results of repeatable experiments lack of agreement between theoretical mathematical models and experimental measurements often leads to important advances as better theories are developed in the physical sciences the traditional mathematical model contains four major elements these are governing equation s defining equation physics defining equation s constitutive equation s constraint mathematics constraint s classifications mathematical models are usually composed of relationships and variable mathematics variables relationships can be described by operator mathematics operators such as algebraic operators functions differential operators etc variables are abstractions of system parameter computer programming parameters of interest that can be quantification science quantified several classification criteria can be used for mathematical models according to their structure linear vs nonlinear if all the operators in a mathematical model exhibit linear ity the resulting mathematical model is defined as linear a model is considered to be nonlinear otherwise the definition of linearity and nonlinearity is dependent on context and linear models may have nonlinear expressions in them for example in a linear model statistical linear model it is assumed that a relationship is linear in the parameters but it may be nonlinear in the predictor variables similarly a differential equation is said to be linear if it can be written with linear differential operator s but it can still have nonlinear expressions in it in a optimization mathematics mathematical programming model if the objective functions and constraints are represented entirely by linear equation s then the model is regarded as a linear model if one or more of the objective functions or constraints are represented with a nonlinearity nonlinear equation then the model is known as a nonlinear model br nonlinearity even in fairly simple systems is often associated with phenomena such as chaos theory chaos and irreversibility although there are exceptions nonlinear systems and models tend to be more difficult to study than linear ones a common approach to nonlinear problems is linearization but this can be problematic if one is trying to study aspects such as irreversibility which are strongly tied to nonlinearity static vs dynamic a dynamic model accounts for time dependent changes in the state of the system while a static or steady state model calculates the system in equilibrium and thus is time invariant dynamic models typically are represented by differential equation s or difference equation s explicit vs implicit if all of the input parameters of the overall model are known and the output parameters can be calculated by a finite series of computations the model is said to be explicit but sometimes it is the output parameters which are known and the corresponding inputs must be solved for by an iterative procedure such as newton s method if the model is linear or broyden s method if non linear in such a case the model is said to be implicit for example a jet engine s physical properties such as turbine and nozzle throat areas can be explicitly calculated given a design thermodynamic cycle air and fuel flow rates pressures and temperatures at a specific flight condition and power setting but the engine s operating cycles at other flight conditions and power settings cannot be explicitly calculated from the constant physical properties discrete vs continuous a discrete modeling discrete model treats objects as discrete such as the particles in a molecular model or the states in a statistical model while a continuous model represents the objects in a continuous manner such as the velocity field of fluid in pipe flows temperatures and stresses in a solid and electric field that applies continuously over the entire model due to a point charge deterministic vs probabilistic stochastic a deterministic system deterministic model is one in which every set of variable states is uniquely determined by parameters in the model and by sets of previous states of these variables therefore a deterministic model always performs the same way for a given set of initial conditions conversely in a stochastic model usually called a statistical model randomness is present and variable states are not described by unique values but rather by probability distributions deductive inductive or floating a deductive model is a logical structure based on a theory an inductive model arises from empirical findings and generalization from them the floating model rests on neither theory nor observation but

significance in the natural sciences mathematical models are of great importance in the natural sciences particularly in physics physical theory theories are almost invariably expressed using mathematical models throughout history more and more accurate mathematical models have been developed newton s laws of motion newton s laws accurately describe many everyday phenomena but at certain limits relativity theory and quantum mechanics must be used even these do not apply to all situations and need further refinement it is possible to obtain the less accurate models in appropriate limits for example relativistic mechanics reduces to newtonian mechanics at speeds much less than the speed of light quantum mechanics reduces to classical physics when the quantum numbers are high for example the de broglie wavelength of a tennis ball is insignificantly small so classical physics is a good approximation to use in this case it is common to use idealized models in physics to simplify things massless ropes point particles ideal gases and the particle in a box are among the many simplified models used in physics the laws of physics are represented with simple equations such as newton s laws maxwell s equations and the schr\xc3\xb6dinger equation these laws are such as a basis for making mathematical models of real situations many real situations are very complex and thus modeled approximate on a computer a model that is computationally feasible to compute is made from the basic laws or from approximate models made from the basic laws for example molecules can be modeled by molecular orbital models that are approximate solutions to the schr\xc3\xb6dinger equation in engineering physics models are often made by mathematical methods such as finite element analysis different mathematical models use different geometries that are not necessarily accurate descriptions of the geometry of the universe euclidean geometry is much used in classical physics while special relativity and general relativity are examples of theories that use geometry geometries which are not euclidean some applications whatever this section is it isn t background original heading and isn t general since prehistory prehistorical times simple models such as map s and mathematical diagram diagrams have been used often when engineers analyze a system to be controlled or optimized they use a mathematical model in analysis engineers can build a descriptive model of the system as a hypothesis of how the system could work or try to estimate how an unforeseeable event could affect the system similarly in control of a system engineers can try out different control approaches in simulation s a mathematical model usually describes a system by a set mathematics set of variables and a set of equations that establish relationships between the variables variables may be of many types real number real or integer numbers boolean data type boolean values or string computing strings for example the variables represent some properties of the system for example measured system outputs often in the form of signal electronics signals chronometry timing data counters and event occurrence yes no the actual model is the set of functions that describe the relations between the different variables building blocks in business and engineering mathematical models may be used to maximize a certain output the system under consideration will require certain inputs the system relating inputs to outputs depends on other variables too decision theory decision variables state variable s exogeny exogenous variables and random variable s decision variables are sometimes known as independent variables exogenous variables are sometimes known as parameter s or constant mathematics constant s the variables are not independent of each other as the state variables are dependent on the decision input random and exogenous variables furthermore the output variables are dependent on the state of the system represented by the state variables goal objective s and constraint mathematics constraint s of the system and its users can be represented as function mathematics function s of the output variables or state variables the objective function s will depend on the perspective of the model s user depending on the context an objective function is also known as an index of performance as it is some measure of interest to the user although there is no limit to the number of objective functions and constraints a model can have using or optimizing the model becomes more involved computationally as the number increases for example economist s often apply linear algebra when using input output model s complicated mathematical models that have many variables may be consolidated by use of vector space vectors where one symbol represents several variables a priori information file blackbox3d withgraphs png thumb 480px to analyse something with a typical black box approach only the behavior of the stimulus response will be accounted for to infer the unknown box the usual representation of this black box system is a data flow diagram centered in the box mathematical modeling problems are often classified into black box or white box software engineering white box models according to how much a priori philosophy a priori information on the system is available a black box model is a system of which there is no a priori information available a white box model also called glass box or clear box is a system where all necessary information is available practically all systems are somewhere between the black box and white box models so this concept is useful only as an intuitive guide for deciding which approach to take usually it is preferable to use as much a priori information as possible to make the model more accurate therefore the white box models are usually considered easier because if you have used the information correctly then the model will behave correctly often the a priori information comes in forms of knowing the type of functions relating different variables for example if we make a model of how a medicine works in a human system we know that usually the amount of medicine in the blood is an exponential decay exponentially decaying function but we are still left with several unknown parameters how rapidly does the medicine amount decay and what is the initial amount of medicine in blood this example is therefore not a completely white box model these parameters have to be estimated through some means before one can use the model in black box models one tries to estimate both the functional form of relations between variables and the numerical parameters in those functions using a priori information we could end up for example with a set of functions that probably could describe the system adequately if there is no a priori information we would try to use functions as general as possible to cover all different models an often used approach for black box models are neural networks which usually do not make assumptions about incoming data alternatively the narmax nonlinear autoregressive moving average model with exogenous inputs algorithms which were developed as part of nonlinear system identification ref name sab1 billings s a 2013 nonlinear system identification narmax methods in the time frequency and spatio temporal domains wiley ref can be used to select the model terms determine the model structure and estimate the unknown parameters in the presence of correlated and nonlinear noise the advantage of narmax models compared to neural networks is that narmax produces models that can be written down and related to the underlying process whereas neural networks produce an approximation that is opaque subjective information sometimes it is useful to incorporate subjective information into a mathematical model this can be done based on intuition knowledge intuition experience or expert opinion or based on convenience of mathematical form bayesian statistics provides a theoretical framework for incorporating such subjectivity into a rigorous analysis we specify a prior probability distribution which can be subjective and then update this distribution based on empirical data an example of when such approach would be necessary is a situation in which an experimenter bends a coin slightly and tosses it once recording whether it comes up heads and is then given the task of predicting the probability that the next flip comes up heads after bending the coin the true probability that the coin will come up heads is unknown so the experimenter would need to make a decision perhaps by looking at the shape of the coin about what prior distribution to use incorporation of such subjective information might be important to get an accurate estimate of the probability complexity file mathematical models for complex systems jpg 300px right thumb this is a schematic representation of three types of mathematical models of complex systems with the level of their mechanistic understanding in general model complexity involves a trade off between simplicity and accuracy of the model occam s razor is a principle particularly relevant to modeling its essential idea being that among models with roughly equal predictive power the simplest one is the most desirable while added complexity usually improves the realism of a model it can make the model difficult to understand and analyze and can also pose computational problems including numerical instability thomas kuhn argues that as science progresses explanations tend to become more complex before a paradigm shift offers radical simplification for example when modeling the flight of an aircraft we could embed each mechanical part of the aircraft into our model and would thus acquire an almost white box model of the system however the computational cost of adding such a huge amount of detail would effectively inhibit the usage of such a model additionally the uncertainty would increase due to an overly complex system because each separate part induces some amount of variance into the model it is therefore usually appropriate to make some approximations to reduce the model to a sensible size engineers often can accept some approximations in order to get a more robust and simple model for example isaac newton newton s classical mechanics is an approximated model of the real world still newton s model is quite sufficient for most ordinary life situations that is as long as particle speeds are well below the speed of light and we study macro particles only training any model which is not pure white box contains some parameter s that can be used to fit the model to the system it is intended to describe if the modeling is done by a neural network or other machine learning the optimization of parameters is called training while the optimization of model hyperparameters is called tuning and often uses cross validation in more conventional modeling through explicitly given mathematical functions parameters are often determined by curve fitting model evaluation a crucial part of the modeling process is the evaluation of whether or not a given mathematical model describes a system accurately this question can be difficult to answer as it involves several different types of evaluation fit to empirical data usually the easiest part of model evaluation is checking whether a model fits experimental measurements or other empirical data in models with parameters a common approach to test this fit is to split the data into two disjoint subsets training data and verification data the training data are used to estimate the model parameters an accurate model will closely match the verification data even though these data were not used to set the model s parameters this practice is referred to as cross validation statistics cross validation in statistics defining a metric mathematics metric to measure distances between observed and predicted data is a useful tool of assessing model fit in statistics decision theory and some economic model s a loss function plays a similar role while it is rather straightforward to test the appropriateness of parameters it can be more difficult to test the validity of the general mathematical form of a model in general more mathematical tools have been developed to test the fit of statistical model s than models involving differential equations tools from non parametric statistics can sometimes be used to evaluate how well the data fit a known distribution or to come up with a general model that makes only minimal assumptions about the model s mathematical form scope of the model assessing the scope of a model that is determining what situations the model is applicable to can be less straightforward if the model was constructed based on a set of data one must determine for which systems or situations the known data is a typical set of data the question of whether the model describes well the properties of the system between data points is called interpolation and the same question for events or data points outside the observed data is called extrapolation as an example of the typical limitations of the scope of a model in evaluating newtonian classical mechanics we can note that newton made his measurements without advanced equipment so he could not measure properties of particles travelling at speeds close to the speed of light likewise he did not measure the movements of molecules and other small particles but macro particles only it is then not surprising that his model does not extrapolate well into these domains even though his model is quite sufficient for ordinary life physics philosophical considerations many types of modeling implicitly involve claims about causality this is usually but not always true of models involving differential equations as the purpose of modeling is to increase our understanding of the world the validity of a model rests not only on its fit to empirical observations but also on its ability to extrapolate to situations or data beyond those originally described in the model one can think of this as the differentiation between qualitative and quantitative predictions one can also argue that a model is worthless unless it provides some insight which goes beyond what is already known from direct investigation of the phenomenon being studied an example of such criticism is the argument that the mathematical models of optimal foraging theory do not offer insight that goes beyond the common sense conclusions of evolution and other basic principles of ecology ref cite journal

b'script theory is a psychology psychological theory which posits that human behaviour largely falls into patterns called scripts because they function analogously to the way a written script does by providing a program for action silvan tomkins created script theory as a further development of his affect theory which regards human beings emotional responses to stimuli as falling into categories called affect psychology affects he noticed that the purely biological response of affect may be followed by awareness and by what we cognition cognitively do in terms of acting on that affect so that more was needed to produce a complete explanation of what he called human being theory in script theory the basic unit of analysis is called a scene defined as a sequence of events linked by the affects triggered during the experience of those events tomkins recognized that our affective experiences fall into patterns that we may group together according to criteria such as the types of persons and places involved and the degree of intensity of the effect experienced the patterns of which constitute scripts that inform our behavior in an effort to maximize positive affect and to minimize negative affect in artificial intelligence roger schank robert p abelson and their research group extended tomkins scripts and used them in early artificial intelligence work as a method of representing procedural knowledge in their work scripts are very much like frame artificial intelligence frames except the values that fill the slots must be ordered a script is a structured representation describing a stereotyped sequence of events in a particular context scripts are used in natural language understanding systems to organize a knowledge base in terms of the situations that the system should understand the classic example of a script involves the typical sequence of events that occur when a person drinks in a restaurant finding a seat reading the menu ordering drinks from the waitstaff in the script form these would be decomposed into conceptual dependency theory conceptual transitions such as mtrans and ptrans which refer to mental transitions of information and physical transitions of things schank abelson and their colleagues tackled some of the most difficult problems in artificial intelligence i e story understanding but ultimately their line of work ended without tangible success this type of work received little attention after the 1980s but it is very influential in later knowledge representation techniques such as case based reasoning scripts can be inflexible to deal with inflexibility smaller modules called memory organization packet s mop can be combined in a way that is appropriate for the situation citation needed date february 2012 references more footnotes date november 2014 nathanson donald l shame and pride affect sex and the birth of the self london w w norton 1992 eve kosofsky sedgwick sedgwick eve kosofsky and adam frank eds 1995 shame and its sisters a silvan tomkins reader durham and london duke university press tomkins silvan script theory the emergence of personality eds joel arnoff a i rabin and robert a zucker new york springer publishing company 1987 147 216 tomkins silvan script theory differential magnification of affects nebraska symposium on motivation 1978 ed richard a deinstbier lincoln ne university of nebraska press 1979 201 236 category history of artificial intelligence category knowledge representation category psychological theories'

suggests the following guidelines for creating mind maps start in the center with an image of the topic using at least 3 colors use images symbols codes and dimensions throughout your mind map select key words and print using upper or lower case letters each word image is best alone and sitting on its own line the lines should be connected starting from the central image the lines become thinner as they radiate out from the center make the lines the same length as the word image they support use multiple colors throughout the mind map for visual stimulation and also for encoding or grouping

october 2011 portland oregon usa ref there are many categorization theories and techniques in a broader historical view however three general approaches to categorization may be identified classical categorization conceptual clustering prototype theory the classical view main categories aristotle classical categorization first appears in the context of western philosophy in the work of plato who in his statesman dialogue statesman dialogue introduces the approach of grouping objects based on their similar property philosophy properties this approach was further explored and systematized by aristotle in his categories aristotle categories treatise where he analyzes the differences between class philosophy class es and object philosophy object s aristotle also applied intensively the classical categorization scheme in his approach to the classification of living beings which uses the technique of applying successive narrowing questions such as is it an animal or vegetable how many feet does it have does it have fur or feathers can it fly establishing this way the basis for natural taxonomy biology taxonomy the classical aristotelianism aristotelian view claims that categories are discrete entities characterized by a set of properties which are shared by their members in analytic philosophy these properties are assumed to establish the conditions which are both necessary and sufficient condition s to capture meaning according to the classical view categories should be clearly defined mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive this way any entity of the given classification universe belongs unequivocally to one and only one of the proposed categories conceptual clustering main conceptual clustering conceptual clustering is a modern variation of the classical approach and derives from attempts to explain how knowledge is represented in this approach class philosophy class es clusters or entities are generated by first formulating their conceptual descriptions and then classifying the entities according to the descriptions conceptual clustering developed mainly during the 1980s as a machine paradigm for unsupervised learning it is distinguished from ordinary cluster analysis data clustering by generating a concept description for each generated category categorization tasks in which category labels are provided to the learner for certain objects are referred to as supervised classification supervised learning or concept learning categorization tasks in which no labels are supplied are referred to as unsupervised classification unsupervised learning or cluster analysis data clustering the task of supervised classification involves extracting information from the labeled examples that allows accurate prediction of class labels of future examples this may involve the abstraction of a rule or concept relating observed object features to category labels or it may not involve abstraction e g exemplar theory exemplar model s the task of clustering involves recognizing inherent structure in a data set and grouping objects together by similarity into classes it is thus a process of generating a classification structure conceptual clustering is closely related to fuzzy set theory in which objects may belong to one or more groups in varying degrees of fitness prototype theory main prototype theory since the research by eleanor rosch and george lakoff in the 1970s categorization can also be viewed as the process of grouping things based on prototype s the idea of necessary and sufficient conditions is almost never met in categories of naturally occurring things it has also been suggested that categorization based on prototypes is the basis for human development and that this learning relies on learning about the world via embodied cognition embodiment a cognition cognitive approach accepts that natural categories are graded they tend to be fuzzy at their boundaries and inconsistent in the status of their constituent members systems of categories are not objectively out there in the world but are rooted in people s experience conceptual categories are not identical for different cultures or indeed for every individual in the same culture categories form part of a hierarchical structure when applied to such subjects as taxonomy biology taxonomy in biological classification higher level life form level middle level generic or genus level and lower level the species level these can be distinguished by certain traits that put an item in its distinctive category but even these can be arbitrary and are subject to revision categories at the middle level are perceptually and conceptually the more salient the generic level of a category tends to elicit the most responses and richest images and seems to be the psychologically basic level typical taxonomies in zoology for example exhibit categorization at the embodied cognition embodied level with similarities leading to formulation of higher categories and differences leading to differentiation within categories miscategorization miscategorization can be a fallacy logical fallacy in which diverse and dissimilar objects concepts entities etc are grouped together based upon illogical common denominators or common denominators that virtually any concept object or entity have in common a common way miscategorization occurs is through an over categorization of concepts objects or entities and then miscategorization based upon characters that virtually all things have in common see also too many

example of multiplication when the set of values includes 0 or there are some commonly desired operations are max and min which do not have inverses the goal is to seek an algorithm which works on all

unary node rake compress pre analysis for the moment let us assume that all nodes have less than three children namely binary generally speaking as long as the degree is bounded the bounds will hold ref morihata akimasa and kiminori matsuzaki a parallel tree contraction algorithm on non binary trees mathematical engineering technical reports 2008 ref but we will analyze the binary case for simplicity in the two degenerate cases listed above the rake is the best tool for dealing with balanced binary trees and compress is the best for linked lists however arbitrary trees will have to require a combination of these operations by this combination we claim a theorem that theorem after o log n expected rake and compress steps a tree is reduced to a single node now rephrase the tree contraction algorithm as follows input a binary tree rooted at r output a single node operation a sequence of contraction steps each consisting of a rake operation and a compress operation in any order the rake operation removes all the leaf nodes in parallel the compress operation finds an independent set graph theory independent set of unary nodes and splice out the selected nodes to approach the theorem we first take a look at a property of a binary tree given a binary tree t we can partition the nodes of t into 3 groups tmath t 0 contains all leaf nodes tmath t 1 contains all nodes with 1 child and tmath t 2 contains all nodes with 2 children it is easy to see that math v t t 0 cup t 1 cup t 2 math now we propose claim math t 0 t 2 1 math this claim can be proved by strong induction on the number of nodes it is easy to see that the base case of n 1 trivially holds and we further assume the claim also holds for any tree with at most n nodes then given a tree with n 1 nodes rooted at r there appears to be two cases if r has only one subtree consider the subtree of r we know that the subtree has the same number of binary nodes and the same number of leaf nodes as the whole tree itself this is true since the root is a unary node and based the previous assumption a unary node does not change either tmath t 0 or tmath t 2 if r has two subtrees we define tmath t 0 l t 2 l to be the leaf nodes and binary nodes in the left subtree respectively similarly we define the same tmath t 0 r t 2 r for the right subtree from previous there is math t 0 l t 2 l 1 math and math t 0 r t 2 r 1 math also we know that t has math t 0 l t 0 r math leaf nodes and math t 2 l t 2 r 1 math binary nodes thus we can derive math t 0 l t 0 r t 2 l 1 t 2 r 1 t 2 l t 2 r 1 1 math which proves the claim following the claim we then prove a lemma which leads us to the theorem lemma the number of nodes of after a contraction step is reduced by a constant factor in expectation assume the number of nodes before the contraction to be m and m after the contraction by definition the rake operation deletes all tmath t 0 and the compress operation deletes at least 1 4 of tmath t 1 in expectation all tmath t 2 remains therefore we can see math e m leq t 2 tfrac 3 4 t 1 leq tfrac 3 4 tfrac 3 4 t 1 tfrac 3 2 t 2 tfrac 3 4 1 t 1 2 t 2 tfrac 3 4 t 0 t 1 t 2 tfrac 3 4 m math finally

of the expressions in the left and right subtrees respectively step 2 when a left right child with 0 children is merged into an operator replace l r with the value of the child step 3 when a node has 1 child it has an expression that is a function of one variable when a left right child with 1 child is merged into an operator replace l r with the expression and change the variable in the expression to l r if appropriate in a node with 2 children the operands in the expression are f l and g r where f and g are linear functions and in a node with 1 child the expression is h x where h is a linear function and x is either l or r we prove this invariant by induction at the beginning the invariant is clearly satisfied there are three types of merges that result in a not fully evaluated expression 1 a 1 child node is merged into a 2 children node 2 a leaf is merged into a 2 children node 3 a 1 child node is merged into a 1 child node all three types of merges do not change the

b'about the structured design approach by architect christopher alexander a pattern language is a method of describing good design practices or patterns of useful organization within a field of expertise the term was coined by architect christopher alexander and popularized by his 1977 book a pattern language a pattern language can also be an attempt to express the deeper wisdom of what brings aliveness within a particular field of human endeavor through a set of interconnected patterns aliveness is one placeholder term for the quality that has no name a sense of wholeness spirit or grace that while of varying form is precise and empirically verifiable cn date march 2016 some advocates who date march 2016 of this design approach claim that ordinary people can use it to successfully solve very large complex design problems what is a pattern see also design pattern when a designer designs something whether a house computer program or lamp they must make many decisions about how to solve problems a single problem is documented with its typical place the syntax and use the grammar with the most common and recognized good solution seen in the wild like the examples seen in dictionary dictionaries each such entry is a single design pattern each pattern has a name a descriptive entry and some cross references much like a dictionary entry a documented pattern should explain why that solution is good in the pattern s contexts elemental or universal patterns such as door or partnership are versatile ideals of design either as found in experience or for use as components in practice explicitly described as holistic resolutions of the forces in recurrent contexts and circumstances whether in architecture medicine software development or governance etc patterns might be invented or found and studied such as the naturally occurring patterns of design that characterize human environments ref henshaw j http www synapse9 com pub 2015 purplsoc jlhfinalpub pdf guiding patterns of naturally occurring design elements purplsoc 2015 proceedings july 3 5 2015 krems austria purplsoc meeting on the many open scientific questions e g regarding the theoretical background of patterns and the practical implementation of pattern methods in research and teaching ref like all languages a pattern language has vocabulary syntax and grammar but a pattern language applies to some complex activity other than communication in pattern languages for design the parts break down in this way the language description the vocabulary is a collection of named described solutions to problems in a field of interest these are called design patterns so for example the language for architecture describes items like settlements buildings rooms windows latches etc each solution includes syntax a description that shows where the solution fits in a larger more comprehensive or more abstract design this automatically links the solution into a web of other needed solutions for example rooms have ways to get light and ways to get people in and out the solution includes grammar that describes how the solution solves a problem or produces a benefit so if the benefit is unneeded the solution is not used perhaps that part of the design can be left empty to save money or other resources if people do not need to wait to enter a room a simple doorway can replace a waiting room in the language description grammar and syntax cross index often with a literal alphabetic index of pattern names to other named solutions so the designer can quickly think from one solution to related needed solutions and document them in a logical way in christopher alexander s book a pattern language the patterns are in decreasing order by size with a separate alphabetic index the web of relationships in the index of the language provides many paths through the design process this simplifies the design work because designers can start the process from any part of the problem they understand and work toward the unknown parts at the same time if the pattern language has worked well for many projects there is reason to believe that even a designer who does not completely understand the design problem at first will complete the design process and the result will be usable for example skiers coming inside must shed snow and store equipment the messy snow and boot cleaners should stay outside the equipment needs care so the racks should be inside many patterns form a language just as words must have grammar grammatical and semantics semantic relationships to each other in order to make a spoken language useful design patterns must be related to each other in position and utility order to form a pattern language christopher alexander s work describes a process of decomposition in which the designer has a problem perhaps a commercial assignment selects a solution then discovers new smaller problems resulting from the larger solution occasionally the smaller problems have no solution and a different larger solution must be selected eventually all of the remaining design problems are small enough or routine enough to be solved by improvisation by the builders and the design is done the actual organizational structure hierarchy hierarchical iterative method iterative etc is left to the discretion of the designer depending on the problem this explicitly lets a designer explore a design starting from some small part when this happens it s common for a designer to realize that the problem is actually part of a larger solution at this point the design almost always becomes a better design in the language therefore each pattern has to indicate its relationships to other patterns and to the language as a whole this gives the designer using the language a great deal of guidance about the related problems that must be solved the most difficult part of having an outside expert apply a pattern language is in fact to get a reliable complete list of the problems to be solved of course the people most familiar with the problems are the people that need a design so alexander famously advocated on site improvisation by concerned empowered users ref a pattern language ibid ref ref alexander christopher the oregon project ref as a powerful way to form very workable large scale initial solutions maximizing the utility of a design and minimizing the design rework the desire to empower users of architecture was in fact what led alexander to undertake a pattern language project for architecture in the first place design problems in a context an important aspect of design patterns is to identify and document the key ideas that make a good system different from a poor system that may be a house a computer program or an object of daily use and to assist in the design of future systems the idea expressed in a pattern should be general enough to be applied in very different systems within its context but still specific enough to give constructive guidance the range of situations in which the problems and solutions addressed in a pattern apply is called its context an important part in each pattern is to describe this context examples can further illustrate how the pattern applies to very different situation for instance alexander s pattern a place to wait addresses bus stops in the same way as waiting rooms in a surgery while still proposing helpful and constructive solutions the design patterns gang of four book design patterns by gamma et al proposes solutions that are independent of the programming language and the program s application domain still the problems and solutions described in a pattern can vary in their level of abstraction and generality on the one side and specificity on the other side in the end this depends on the author s preferences however even a very abstract pattern will usually contain examples that are by nature absolutely concrete and specific patterns can also vary in how far they are proven in the real world alexander gives each pattern a rating by zero one or two stars indicating how well they are proven in real world examples it is generally claimed that all patterns need at least some existing real world examples it is however conceivable to document yet unimplemented ideas in a pattern like format the patterns in alexander s book also vary in their level of scale some describing how to build a town or neighbourhood others dealing with individual buildings and the interior of rooms alexander sees the low scale artifacts as constructive elements of the large scale world so they can be connected to a aggregation in an associative network pattern language hierarchic network balancing of forces a pattern must characterize the problems that it is meant to solve the context or situation where these problems arise and the conditions under which the proposed solutions can be recommended often these problems arise from a conflict of different interests or forces a pattern emerges as a dialogue that will then help to balance the forces and finally make a decision for instance there could be a pattern suggesting a wireless telephone the forces would be the need to communicate and the need to get other things done at the same time cooking inspecting the bookshelf a very specific pattern would be just wireless telephone more general patterns would be wireless device or secondary activity suggesting that a secondary activity such as talking on the phone or inspecting the pockets of your jeans should not interfere with other activities though quite unspecific in its context the forces in the secondary activity pattern are very similar to those in wireless telephone thus the competing forces can be seen as part of the essence of a design concept expressed in a pattern patterns contain their own rationale usually a pattern contains a rationale referring to some given values for christopher alexander it is most important to think about the people who will come in contact with a piece of architecture one of his key values is making these people feel more alive he talks about the quality without a name qwan more generally we could say that a good system should be accepted welcomed and happily embraced as an enrichment of daily life by those who are meant to use it or even better by all people it affects for instance when discussing a street caf\xc3\xa9 alexander discusses the possible desires of a guest but also mentions people who just walk by the same thinking can be applied to technical devices such as telephones and cars to social structures like a team working on a project or to the user interface of a computer program the qualities of a software system for instance could be rated by observing whether users spend their time enjoying or struggling with the system by focusing on the impacts on human life we can identify patterns that are independent from changing technology and thus find timeless quality alexander generic structure and layout usually the author of a pattern language or collection chooses a generic structure for all the patterns it contains breaking each into generic sections like context problem statement solution etc christopher alexander s patterns for instance each consist of a short name a rating up to two symbols a sensitizing picture the context description the problem statement a longer part of text with examples and explanations a solution statement a sketch and further references this structure and layout is sometimes referred to as the alexandrian form alexander uses a special text layout to mark the different sections of his patterns for instance the problem statement and the solution statement are printed in bold font the latter is always preceded by the therefore keyword some authors instead use explicit labels which creates some degree of redundancy meaningful names when design is done by a team pattern names will form a vocabulary they can share this makes it necessary for pattern names to be easy to remember and highly descriptive some examples from alexander s works are window place helps define where windows should go in a room and a place to wait helps define the characteristics of bus stops and hospital waiting rooms for example aggregation in an associative network pattern language a pattern language as conceived by alexander contains links from one pattern to another so when trying to apply one pattern in a project a designer is pushed to other patterns that are considered helpful in its context in alexander s book such links are collected in the references part and echoed in the linked pattern s context part thus the overall structure is a directed graph a pattern that is linked to in the references usually addresses a problem of lower scale that is suggested as a part of the higher scale problem for instance the public outdoor room pattern has a reference to stair seats even without the pattern description these links along with meaningful names carry a message when building a place outside where people can spend time public outdoor room consider to surround it by stairs where people can sit stair seats if you are planning an office workshops and offices consider to arrange workspaces in small groups small working groups alexander argues that the connections in the network can be considered even more meaningful than the text of the patterns themselves the links in alexander s book clearly result in a hierarchic network alexander draws a parallel to the hierarchy of a grammar that is one argument for him to speak of a pattern language the idea of linking is generally accepted among pattern authors though the semantic rationale behind the links may vary some authors however like gamma et al in design patterns make only little use of pattern linking possibly because it did not make that much sense for their collection of patterns in such a case we would speak of a pattern catalogue rather than a pattern language ref name dearden cite journal author andy dearden janet finlay title pattern languages in hci a critical review date january 2006

describing one of the configurations that brings life to a building each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment and then describes the core solution to that problem in such a way that you can use the solution a million times over without ever doing it the same way twice a pattern language is a network of patterns that call upon one another patterns help us remember insights and knowledge about design and can be used in combination to create solutions application domains christopher alexander s idea has been adopted in other disciplines often much more heavily than the original pattern architecture application of patterns to architecture as depicted the book a pattern language recent examples include software design pattern s in software

b'hatnote not to be confused with trie a specific type of tree data structure refimprove date august 2010 file binary tree svg right 192 thumb a simple unordered tree in this diagram the node labeled 7 has two children labeled 2 and 6 and one parent labeled 2 the root node at the top has no parent in computer science a tree is a widely used abstract data type adt or data structure implementing this adt that simulates a hierarchical tree structure with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node represented as a set of linked vertex graph theory nodes a tree data structure can be defined recursion recursively locally as a collection of node computer science nodes starting at a root node where each node is a data structure consisting of a value together with a list of references to nodes the children with the constraints that no reference is duplicated and none points to the root alternatively a tree can be defined abstractly as a whole globally as an ordered tree with a value assigned to each node both these perspectives are useful while a tree can be analyzed mathematically as a whole when actually represented as a data structure it is usually represented and worked with separately by node rather than as a list of nodes and an adjacency list of edges between nodes as one may represent a digraphs digraph for instance for example looking at a tree as a whole one can talk about the parent node of a given node but in general as a data structure a given node only contains the list of its children but does not contain a reference to its parent if any

with no nodes is called the null or empty tree a tree that is not empty consists of a root node and potentially many levels of additional nodes that form a hierarchy terminology used in trees term root defn the top node in a tree term child defn a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root term parent defn the converse notion of a child term siblings defn a group of

disjoint trees data type vs data structure there is a distinction between a tree as an abstract data type and as a concrete data structure analogous to the distinction between a list abstract data type list and a linked list as a data type a tree has a value and children and the children are themselves trees the value and children of the tree are interpreted as the value of the root node and the subtrees of the children of the root node to allow finite trees one must either allow the list of children to be empty in which case trees can be required to be non empty an empty tree instead being represented by a forest of zero trees or allow trees to be empty in which case the list of children can be of fixed size branching factor especially 2 or binary if desired as a data structure a linked tree is a group of node computer science nodes where each node has a value and a list of reference computer science references to other nodes its children this data structure actually defines a directed graph efn properly a rooted ordered directed graph because it may have loops or several references to the same node just as a linked list may have a loop thus there is also the requirement that no two references point to the same node that each node has at most a single parent and in fact exactly one parent except for the root and a tree that violates this is corrupt due to the use of references to trees in the linked tree data structure trees are often discussed implicitly assuming that they are being represented by references to the root node as this is often how they are actually implemented for example rather than an empty tree one may have a null reference a tree is always non empty but a reference to a tree may be null recursive recursively as a data type a tree is defined as a value of some data type possibly empty together with a list of trees possibly an empty list the subtrees of its children symbolically t v nowiki t 1 t k nowiki a tree t consists of a value v and a list of other trees more elegantly via mutual recursion of which a tree is one of the most basic examples a tree can be defined in terms of a forest a list of trees where a tree consists of a value and a forest the subtrees of its children f nowiki t 1 t k nowiki t v f note that this definition is in terms of values and is appropriate in functional language s it assumes referential transparency computer science referential transparency different trees have no connections as they are simply lists of values as a data structure a tree is defined as a node the root which itself consists of a value of some data type possibly empty together with a list of references to other nodes list possibly empty references possibly null symbolically n v nowiki amp n 1 amp n k nowiki a node n consists of a value v and a list of references to other nodes this data structure defines a directed graph efn properly a rooted ordered directed graph and for it to be a tree one must add a condition on its global structure its topology namely that at most one reference can point to any given node a node has at most a single parent and no node in the tree point to the root in fact every node other than the root must have exactly one parent and the root must have no parents indeed given a list of nodes and for each node a list of references to its children one cannot tell if this structure is a tree or not without analyzing its global structure and that it is in fact topologically a tree as defined below type theory as an abstract data type adt the abstract tree type t with values of some type e is defined using the abstract forest type f list of trees by the functions value t \xe2\x86\x92 e children t \xe2\x86\x92 f nil \xe2\x86\x92 f node e \xc3\x97 f \xe2\x86\x92 t with the axioms value node e f e children node e f f in terms of type theory a tree is an recursive data type inductive type defined by the constructors nil empty forest and node tree with root node with given value and children mathematical viewed as a whole a tree data structure is an ordered tree generally with values attached to each node concretely it is if required to be non empty a rooted tree with the away from root direction a more narrow term is an arborescence graph theory arborescence meaning a directed graph whose underlying undirected graph is a tree graph theory tree any two vertices are connected by exactly one simple path with a distinguished root one vertex is designated as the root which determines the direction on the edges arrows point away from the root given an edge the node that the edge points from is called the parent and the node that the edge points to is called the child together with an ordering on the child nodes of a given node and a value of some data type at each node often trees have a fixed more properly bounded branching factor outdegree particularly always having two child nodes possibly empty hence at most two non empty child nodes hence a binary tree allowing empty trees makes some definitions simpler some more complicated a rooted tree must be non empty hence if empty trees are allowed the above definition instead becomes an empty tree or a rooted tree such that on the other hand empty trees simplify defining fixed branching factor with empty trees allowed a binary tree is a tree such that every node has exactly two children each of which is a tree possibly empty the complete sets of operations on tree must include fork operation terminology a node computer science node is a structure which may contain a value or condition or represent a separate data structure which could be a tree of its own each node in a tree has zero or more child nodes which are below it in the tree by convention trees are drawn growing downwards a node that has a child is called the child s parent node or ancestor node or superior hierarchy superior a node has at most one parent an internal node also known as an inner node inode for short or branch node is any node of a tree that has child nodes similarly an external node also known as an outer node leaf node or terminal node is any node that does not have child nodes the topmost node in a tree is called the root node depending on definition a tree may be required to have a root node in which case all trees are non empty or may be allowed to be empty in which case it does not necessarily have a root node being the topmost node the root node will not have a parent it is the node at which algorithms on the tree begin since as a data structure one can only pass from parents to children note that some algorithms such as post order depth first search begin at the root but first visit leaf nodes access the value of leaf nodes only visit the root last i e they first access the children of the root but only access the value of the root last all other nodes can be reached from it by following edges or links in the formal definition each such path is also unique in diagrams the root node is conventionally drawn at the top in some trees such as heap data structure heaps the root node has special properties every node in a tree can be seen as the root node of the subtree rooted at that node the height of a node is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf from that node the height of the root is the height of the tree the depth of a node is the length of the path to its root i e its root path this is commonly needed in the manipulation of the various self balancing trees avl trees in particular the root node has depth zero leaf nodes have height zero and a tree with only a single node hence both a root and leaf has depth and height zero conventionally an empty tree tree with no nodes if such are allowed has depth and height \xe2\x88\x921 a subtree of a tree t is a tree consisting of a node in t and all of its descendants in t efn this is different from the formal definition of subtree used in graph theory which is a subgraph that forms a tree it need not include all descendants for example the root node by itself is a subtree in the graph theory sense but not in the data structure sense unless there are no descendants ref mathworld id subtree title subtree ref nodes thus correspond to subtrees each node corresponds to the subtree of itself and all its descendants the subtree corresponding to the root node is the entire tree and each node is the root node of the subtree it determines the subtree corresponding to any other node is called a proper subtree by analogy to a proper subset drawing trees trees are often drawn in the plane ordered trees can be represented essentially uniquely in the plane and are hence called plane trees as follows if one fixes a conventional order say counterclockwise and arranges the child nodes in that order first incoming parent edge then first child edge etc this yields an embedding of the tree in the plane unique up to ambient isotopy conversely such an embedding determines an ordering of the child nodes if one places the root at the top parents above children as in a family tree and places all nodes that are a given distance from the root in terms of number of edges the level of a tree on a given horizontal line one obtains a standard drawing of the tree given a binary tree the first child is on the left the left node and the second child is on the right the right node representations there are many different ways to represent trees common representations represent the nodes as dynamic memory allocation dynamically allocated records with pointers to their children their parents or both or as items in an array data structure array with relationships between them determined by their positions in the array e g binary heap indeed a binary tree can be implemented as a list of lists a list where the values are lists the head of a list the value of the first term is the left child subtree while the tail the list of second and subsequent terms is the right child subtree this can be modified to allow values as well as in lisp s expression s where the head value of first term is the value of the node the head of the tail value of second term is the left child and the tail of the tail list of third and subsequent terms is the right child in general a node in a tree will not have pointers to its parents but this information can be included expanding the data structure to also include a pointer to the parent or stored separately alternatively upward links can be included in the child node data as in a threaded binary tree generalizations digraphs if edges to child nodes are thought of as references then a tree is a special case of a digraph and the tree data structure can be generalized to represent directed graph s by removing the constraints that a node may have at most one parent and that no cycles are allowed edges are still abstractly considered as pairs of nodes however the terms parent and child are usually replaced by different terminology for example source and target different graph data structure representations implementation strategies exist a digraph can be represented by the same local data structure as a tree node with value and list of children assuming that list of children is a list of references or globally by such structures as adjacency list s in graph theory a tree graph theory tree is a connected acyclic graph data structure graph unless stated otherwise in graph theory trees and graphs are assumed undirected there is no one to one correspondence between such trees and trees as data structure we can take an arbitrary undirected tree arbitrarily pick one of its vertex graph theory vertices as the root make all its edges directed by making them point away from the root node producing an arborescence graph theory arborescence and assign an order to all the nodes the result corresponds to a tree data structure picking a different root or different ordering produces a different one given a node in a tree its children define an ordered forest the union of subtrees given by all the children or equivalently taking the subtree given by the node itself and erasing the root just as subtrees are natural for recursion as in a depth first search forests are natural for corecursion as in a breadth first search via mutual recursion a forest can be defined as a list of trees represented by root nodes where a node of a tree consists of a value and a forest its children f nowiki n 1 n k nowiki n v f traversal methods main article tree traversal stepping through the items of a tree by means of the connections between parents and children is called walking the tree and the action is a walk of the tree often an operation might be performed when a pointer arrives at a particular node a walk in which each parent node is traversed before its children is called a pre order walk a walk in which the children are traversed before their respective parents are traversed is called a post order walk a walk in which a node s left subtree then the node itself and finally its right subtree are traversed is called an in order traversal this last scenario referring to exactly two subtrees a left subtree and a right subtree assumes specifically a binary tree a level order walk effectively performs a breadth first search over the entirety of a tree nodes are traversed level by level where the root node is visited first followed by its direct child nodes and their siblings followed by its grandchild nodes and their siblings etc until all nodes in the tree have been traversed common operations enumerating all the items enumerating a section of a tree searching for an item adding a new item at a certain position on the tree deleting an item pruning algorithm pruning removing a

political discourse into three concentric spheres consensus legitimate controversy and deviance in the sphere of consensus journalists assume everyone agrees the sphere of legitimate controversy includes the standard political debates and journalists are expected to remain neutral the sphere of deviance falls outside the bounds of legitimate debate and journalists can ignore it these boundaries shift as public opinion shifts ref http www cjr org analysis trump inspires murrow moment for journalism php for journalists covering trump a murrow moment by david mindich columbia journalism review july 15 2016 ref hallin s spheres which deals with the media are similar to the overton window which deals with public opinion generally and posits a sliding scale of public opinion on any given issue ranging from conventional wisdom to unacceptable hallin used the concept of framing social sciences framing to describe the presentation and reception of issues in public for example framing the use of drugs as criminal activity can encourage the public to consider that behavior anti social hallin also used the concept of an opinion corridor in which the range of public opinion narrows and opinion outside that corridor moves from legitimate controversy into deviance description sphere of consensus this sphere contains those topics on which there is widespread agreement or at least the perception thereof within the sphere of consensus journalists feel free to invoke a generalized we and to take for granted shared values and shared assumptions ref schudson 2002 p 40 ref example include such things as free speech the abolition of slavery or human rights for topic in this sphere journalists do not feel compelled to present an opposing view point or to remain disinterested observers ref name dh sphere of legitimate controversy for topics in this sphere rational and informed people hold differing views these topics are therefore the most important to cover and also ones upon which journalists are obliged to remain disinterested reporters rather than advocating for or against a particular view ref hallin 1986 p 116 ref schudson notes that hallin in his influential study of the us media during the vietnam war argues that journalism s commitment to objectivity has always been compartmentalized that is within a certain sphere the sphere of legitimate controversy journalists seek conscientiously to be balanced and objective ref schudson m 2002 what s unusual about covering politics as usual in zelizer b allan s eds journalism after september 11 london routledge p 40 ref sphere of deviance topics in this sphere are rejected by journalists as being unworthy of general consideration such views are perceived as being either unfounded taboo or of such minor consequence that they are not news worthy hallin argues that in the sphere of deviance journalists also depart from standard norms of objective reporting and feel authorized to treat as marginal laughable dangerous or ridiculous individuals and groups who fall far outside a range of variation taken as legitimate ref schudson 2002 40 ref for example a person claiming that aliens are manipulating college basketball scores might have difficulty finding media coverage for such a claim ref hallin 1986 p 117 ref uses of the terms craig watkins 2001 pp nbsp 92

october 16 1995 watkins analyzes the dominant framing practices problem definition rhetorical devices use of sources and images employed by journalists to make sense of this particular expression of political protest he argues that hallins three spheres are a way for media framing practices to develop specific reportorial contexts each sphere develops its own distinct style of news reporting

project between instituto nacional de biodiversidad and gbif spain in 2005 a series of iterations in which elements were defined and implanted in different projects resulted in a plinian core flat deprecated as a result a new development was impulse to overcome them in 2012 new formal requirements additional input and a will to better support the standard and its documentation as well as to align it with the processes of tdwg the world reference body for biodiversity information standards a new version plinian core v3 1 was defined this provides more flexibility to fully represent the information of a species in a variety of scenarios new elements to deal with aspects such as ipr related resources referenced etc were introduced and elements already included were better defined and documented partner for the development of plinian core in this new phase incorporated the university of granada ug spain the alexander von humboldt institute iavh colombia the national commission for
