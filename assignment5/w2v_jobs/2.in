or formatted data from secondary storage removable media or computer file files when the data stored in them cannot be accessed in a normal way the data is most often salvaged from storage media such as internal or external hard disk drive s hdds solid state drive s ssds usb flash drive s magnetic tape data storage magnetic tapes cd s dvd s raid subsystems and other electronic devices recovery may be required due to physical damage to the storage devices or logical damage to the file system that prevents it from being mount computing mounted by the host operating system os the most common data recovery scenario involves an operating system failure malfunction of a storage device logical failure of storage devices accidental damage or deletion etc typically on a single drive single disk partition partition single os system in which case the ultimate goal is simply to copy all important files from the damaged media to another new drive this can be easily accomplished using a live cd many of which provide a means to mount computing mount the system drive and backup drives or removable media and to move the files from the system drive to the backup media with a file manager or optical disc authoring software such cases can often be mitigated by disk partition ing and consistently storing valuable data files or copies of them on a different partition from the replaceable os system files another scenario involves a drive level failure such as a compromised file system or drive partition or a hard disk drive failure in any of these cases the data is not easily read from the media devices depending on the situation solutions involve repairing the logical file system partition table or master boot record or updating the firmware or drive recovery techniques ranging from software based recovery of corrupted data hardware and software based recovery of damaged service areas also known as the hard disk drive s firmware to hardware replacement on a physically damaged drive which involves changes the parts of the damaged drive to make the data in a readable form and can be copied to a new drive if a drive recovery is necessary the drive itself has typically failed permanently and the focus is rather on a one time recovery salvaging whatever data can be read in a third scenario files have been accidentally file deletion deleted from a storage medium by the users typically the contents of deleted files are not removed immediately from the physical drive instead references to them in the directory structure are removed and thereafter space they deleted data occupy is made available for later data overwriting in the mind of end user s deleted files cannot be discoverable through a standard file manager but the deleted data still technically exists on the physical drive in the meantime the original file contents remain often in a number of disconnected file system fragmentation fragments and may be recoverable if not overwritten by other data files the term data recovery is also used in the context of computer forensics forensic applications or espionage where data which have been encryption encrypted or hidden rather than damaged are recovered sometimes data present in the computer gets encrypted or hidden due to reasons like virus attack which can only be recovered by some computer forensic experts physical damage see also data

and in many cases the logical structures of the file system are damaged as well any logical damage must be dealt with before files can be salvaged from the failed media most physical damage cannot be repaired by end users for example opening a hard disk drive in a normal environment can allow airborne dust to settle on the platter and become caught between the platter and the read write head causing new head crashes that further damage the platter and thus compromise the recovery process furthermore end users generally do not have the hardware or technical expertise required to make these

b'document retrieval is defined as the matching of some stated user query against a set of free text records these records could be any type of mainly natural language unstructured text such as newspaper article s real estate records or paragraphs in a manual user queries can range from multi sentence full descriptions of an information need to a few words document retrieval is sometimes referred to as or as a branch of text retrieval text retrieval is a branch of information retrieval where the information is stored primarily in the form of natural language text text databases became decentralized thanks to the personal computer and the cd rom text retrieval is a critical area of study today since it is the fundamental basis of all internet search engine s description document retrieval systems find information to given criteria by matching text records documents against user queries as opposed to expert system s that answer questions by inference inferring over a logical knowledge base knowledge database a document retrieval system consists of a database of documents a classification algorithm to build a full text index and a user interface to access the database a document retrieval system has two main tasks find relevant documents to user queries evaluate the matching results and sort them according to relevance using algorithms such as pagerank internet search engines are classical applications of document retrieval the vast majority of retrieval systems currently in use range from simple boolean systems through to systems using statistical or natural language processing techniques variations there are two main classes of indexing schemata for document retrieval systems form based or word based and content based indexing the document classification scheme or search engine indexing indexing algorithm in use determines the nature of the document retrieval system form based form based document retrieval addresses the exact syntactic properties of a text comparable to substring matching in string searches the text is generally unstructured and not necessarily in a natural language the system could for example be used to process large sets of chemical representations in molecular biology a suffix tree algorithm is an example for form based indexing content based the content based approach exploits semantic connections between documents and parts thereof and semantic connections between queries and documents most content based document retrieval systems use an inverted index algorithm a signature file is a technique that creates a quick and dirty filter for example a bloom filter that will keep all the documents that match to the query and hopefully a few ones that do not the way this is done is by creating for each file a signature typically a hash coded version one method is superimposed coding a post processing step is done to discard the false alarms since in most cases this structure is inferior to inverted file s in terms of speed size and functionality it is not used widely however with proper parameters it can beat the inverted files in certain environments example pubmed the pubmed ref cite journal

b'the edp electronic document professional is a professional designation awarded by xplor international for participants in the electronic document industry who have satisfied a number of criteria the edp is not a measure of specific knowledge but awardees normally have a broad knowledge of the electronic document industry along with specific knowledge in one or more areas thus the edp differs from certifications such as the cdia from comptia in which the awardee has passed a formal exam rather the edp is more closely related to the older mit and lit designations from aiim generally the edp does show that the awardee has been in the industry for at least 5 years and has participated in at least 3 major projects showing competence in a number of bodies of knowledge the edp program is regulated by the edp commission of xplor international which is a body of senior professionals in the electronic document industry who set the standards and judge the qualifications of the applicants history the first edp class as the annual group of awardees is called was in 1990 when 12 industry professionals were given the award in 1991 the class was much smaller only 6 but in 1992 and in all the years following the number of awardees has generally been double digits with as many as 25 at one time the dutch chapter of xplor international has particularly stressed the edp designation as an essential part of being a professional in the electronic document industry with the result that in some years more than ten dutch members alone were named edps and there are more edps per capita in the

permanently and unambiguously identifies the object to which it is associated and it associates metadata with objects allowing it to provide users with relevant pieces of information about the objects and their relationships included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow doi names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found to achieve its goals the doi system combines the handle system and the indecs content model with a social infrastructure the handle system ensures that the doi name for an object is not based on any changeable attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its doi name and that no two objects are assigned the same doi name because doi names are short character strings they are human readable may be copied and pasted as text and fit into the uniform resource identifier uri specification the doi name resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes so that users communicate with it in the same way as with any other web service it is built on open architecture s incorporates computational trust trust mechanisms and is

approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed the comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as identifiers doesn t mean that they can be compared easily other identifier systems may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance examples include persistent uniform resource locator purl urls globally unique identifier s guids etc but may lack some of the functionality of a registry

b'an archival resource key ark is a uniform resource locator url that is a multi purpose persistent identifier for information objects of any type an ark contains the label ark after the url s hostname which sets the expectation that when submitted to a web browser the url terminated by returns a brief metadata record and the url terminated by returns metadata that includes a commitment statement from the current service provider the ark and its inflections and gain access to three facets of a provider s ability to provide persistence implicit in the design of the ark scheme is that persistence is purely a matter of service and not a property of a naming syntax moreover that a persistent identifier cannot be born persistent but an identifier from any scheme may only be proved persistent over time the inflections provide information with which to judge an identifier s likelihood of persistence arks can be maintained and resolved locally using open source software such as

b'image aperture card jpg 400px right an aperture card is a type of punched card with a cut out window into which a chip of microform microfilm is mounted such a card is used for archive archiving or for making multiple inexpensive copies of a document for ease of distribution the card is typically punched with machine readable metadata associated with the microfilm image and printed across the top of the card for visual identification the microfilm chip is most commonly 35mm in height and contains an optics optically reduced image usually of some type of reference document such as an engineering drawing that is the focus of the archiving process aperture cards have several advantages and disadvantages when compared to digital systems machinery exists to automatically store retrieve sort duplicate create and digitize cards with a high level of automation while many aperture cards still play an important role in archiving their role is gradually being replaced by digital

the drawing for example the drawing number could be both punched and printed on the remainder of the card with the proper machinery this allows for automated handling in the absence of such machinery the cards can still be read by a human with a lens and a light source advantages aperture cards have for archival purposes some advantages over digital systems they have a 500 year lifetime they are human readable and there is no expense or risk in converting from one digital format to the next when computer systems become obsolete ref cite journal first ed last loturco title the engineering

related to the well established differences in analog and digital technology in particular searching for given strings within content is considerably slower handling physical cards requires proprietary machinery and processing optical film takes significant time the very nature of microfilm cameras and the high contrast properties of microfilm stock itself also impose limits on the amount of detail that can be resolved particularly at the higher reduction ratios 36x or greater needed to film larger drawings faded drawings or those of low or uneven contrast do not reproduce well and significant detail or annotations may be lost in common with other forms of microfilm mis filing cards after use particularly in large archives results in the card being for all intents and purposes lost forever unless it s later found by accident aperture cards created from 35mm roll film mounted on to blank cards have to be treated with great care bending the card can cause the film to detach and excessive pressure to a stack of cards can cause the mounting glue to ooze creating clumps of cards which will feed through duplicators and other machinery either poorly or not at all feeding a de laminated card through machinery not only risks destroying the image it also risks jamming or damaging the machinery machinery a set of cards could be rapidly sorted by drawing number or

linux os x and windows are available from sourceforge mode of operation xena attempts to avoid digital obsolescence by converting files into an openly specified format such as opendocument odf or portable network graphics png if the file format is not supported or the binary normalisation option is selected xena will perform ascii base64 encoding on binary files and wrap the output in xml metadata the resulting xena file is plain text although the content of the data itself is not directly human readable the exact original file can be retrieved by stripping the metadata and reversing the base64 encoding using an internal viewer features platforms supported by xena are microsoft windows linux and mac os x xena uses a series of plugins to identify file formats and convert them to an appropriate openly specified format xena has an application programming interface which allows any reasonably skilled java developer to develop a plugin to cover a new file type xena can process individual files or whole directories when processing a whole directory it can preserve the original directory structure of the converted records xena can create plain text versions of file formats such as tagged image file format tiff microsoft word word and portable document format pdf with the use of tesseract software the xena interface or xena viewer can be used to view or export a xena

receive imails however normal email s are visible to an isp and to the administrators of the mail servers providing the service https or secure connections still allow the server admin to view the content of an email and its related ip number in invisible mails both the mail s content and the identities of the sender as well as the receiver remain unknown to a third party observer or attacker furthermore all imails are automatically and transparently end to end principle end to end encrypted at present imail cannot be sent to regular email accounts imail addresses are called imail destinations they are much longer than the average email addresses and do not carry the sign nor a domain they already include the encryption key so using an imail destination is not harder than using standard email with gnu privacy guard gpg encryption the destination is two in one the address as well as the public key in contrast to gpg or pgp encrypted emails i2p bote also encrypts the mail headers i2p bote also works as an anonymous or pseudonymous remailer imails are sent via the i2p network a secure and pseudonymous p2p overlay network on the internet and sender and receiver need not be online at the same time store and forward model the entire system is serverless and fully distributed imail peer to peer peer s accept forward store and deliver messages neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously they need connect only briefly for as long as it takes to send or receive messages an imail message consists of three components the message envelope the message header and the message body the message header contains control information including minimally one or more recipient addresses usually descriptive information is also added such as a subject header field and a message submission date time stamp imails can carry international typesets and have small multi media content attachments a process standardized in request for comments rfc 2045 through 2049 collectively these rfcs have come to be called multipurpose internet mail extensions mime features secure messages all imail messages are automatically end to end encrypted from the

delivering binary or text files of unspecified size in principle there is no technical intrinsic restriction in the i2p bote protocol limiting the size or number of attachments in practice however the slow speeds overheads and data volume due to redundancy limit the viable size of files or the size of an entire message email spoofing main email spoofing email spoofing occurs when the header information of an email is altered to make the message appear to come from a known or trusted source in the case of imails this is countered by cryptography cryptographically signing each imail with its originator s key tracking of sent mails the i2p bote mail service provides no mechanisms for tracking a transmitted message but a means to verify that it has been delivered which however does not necessarily mean it has been read drawbacks imails can only be received or sent via the web interface there is no implementation of pop3 or smtp for imail yet furthermore there are no bridges that

compresses them separately to create a djvu file the initial image is first separated into three images a background image a foreground image and a mask image the background and foreground images are typically lower resolution color images e g 100 dpi the mask image is a high resolution bilevel image e g 300 dpi and is typically where the text is stored the background and foreground images are then compressed using a wavelet compression wavelet compression wavelet based compression algorithm named iw44 ref name djvupaper the mask image is compressed using a method called jb2 similar to jbig2 the jb2 encoding method identifies nearly identical shapes on the page such as multiple occurrences of a particular character in a given font style and size it compresses the bitmap of each unique shape separately and then encodes the locations where each shape appears on the page thus instead of compressing a letter e in a given font multiple times it compresses the letter e once as a compressed bit image and then records every place on the page it occurs optionally these shapes may be mapped to utf 8 codes either by hand or potentially by a text recognition text recognition system and stored in the djvu file if this mapping exists it is possible to select and copy text since jbig2 was based on jb2 both compression methods have the same problems when performing lossy compression numbers may be substituted with similar looking numbers such as replacing 6 with 8 if the text was scanned at a low dpi prior to lossy compression format licensing djvu is an open file format with

b'teleadministration is based on the concept that documents in electronic format have legal value administrative informatics is not new but for many years it was merely information technology applied to legal documents that is the reproduction of paper based legal documents into electronic file systems instead teleadministration turns this approach into its head it is based on research conducted in 1978 the year when at a conference promoted by the court of cassation italy court of cassation it giovanni duni giovanni duni launched the then futuristic idea that an electronic document could have legal value ref 1 duni g l utilizzabilit\xc3\xa0 delle tecniche elettroniche nell emanazione degli atti e nei procedimenti amministrativi spunto per una teoria dell atto amministrativo emanato

procedures and more specifically those that are initiated by a party realize the electronic one stop shop the fundamentals of teleadministration in the decades from 1970 to 1990 the supreme court of cassation italy court of cassation was at the core of research on the relationship between it and law organising international conferences every five years on the topic the 1993 international conference featured the fundamentals of teleadministration providing the details of the administrative systems behind the one stop shop concept ref 8 duni g presentation at the 5th international

manages the entire procedure a single administrative file is created no matter how many different administrations may be involved for both internal and external stages in an administrative procedure a warning signal is sent telematically to the relevant office where the next stage is due the employee in that office then becomes responsible for that phase of the procedure any information concerning records already held by public administration is accessed telematically without involving the citizen the electronic signature identifies the identity of the operator through sophisticated techniques the original of an administrative act is electronic and is therefore always available telematically to any administration that may need it the presence of an increasing amount of on line data will necessitate greater use of automatic data processing in decision making saving data on multiple memory locations will guarantee the safekeeping of the acts statistical data will be available in real time and under multiple profiles with great benefits for top level decision making private citizens can obtain paper copies of the electronic acts it should be noted that the 5th fundamental mentions electronic rather than digital signatures this is because in the jurists domain digital signatures were not yet known the generic reference to the electronic signature is however valid and its general nature is actually suitable for the rules contained six years later in the directive 1999 93 ec as we will see the directive refers in particular to all procedures initiated by private citizens but the system remains valid for all procedures initiated by the administration offices as well acknowledgement of the principles in current law the legally accepted form of acts and documents evolved according to the following stages acts only exist in paper form acts in electronic format are a possible option electronic format is compulsory safe for a few exceptions in italy phase 2 was launched by art 15 para 2 law n 59 of 15 march 1997 the so called bassanini 1 law it established the legal value of electronic documents while regulations would establish the authentication criteria the ec intervened later with its directive 1999 93 ec of the european parliament and the council of the european union council of 13 december 1999 transposed by law decree n 10 of 23 january 2002 which imposes an obligation on member states to give legal value to documents with digital signatures not directly named as such but all their features are described in the directive it also establishes that electronic documents should not be rejected a priori hence opening to a range of different solutions to establish the authorship of a document the so called weak signatures the 1993 directive was revoked and absorbed for reasons of legal certainty and clarity by regulation 910 2014 of the european parliament and council of 23 july 2014 also known as eidas regulation in the ojeu 28 august 2014 which did not renege on the principle of also accepting the so called weak signatures in italy the move to phase 3 was established by art 40 of legislative sl decree n 82 of 7 march 2007 code of digital administration cad entitled creation of electronic documents which states public administrations make the original copy of their documents with electronic means according to the provisions of the present code and the technical specifications of article 71 exceptions are extremely rare comma 3 states by means of appropriate regulations\xe2\x80\xa6 proposed by the delegated ministers for public functions innovation and technology and the minister for cultural heritage and activities the categories of administrative documents that can be created on paper in original are identified having regard to the special historical and archive value they will have by nature think for example of the resignation of a president of the republic unfortunately national administrations are ignoring this provision and today it is only private companies that are no longer allowed paper based communication with public administrations art n 5 bis of the cad and d p c m 22 july 2011 compulsory electronic invoicing was added on 31 march 2015 by law n 44 of 24 december 2007 art n 1 para 209 214 implemented by ministerial decree n 55 of 3 april 2013 further clarified by ministerial circular n 1 of 9 march 2015 the modernisation of procedures was also touched by presidential decree n 447 of 20 october 1998 creation of the one stop shop but only for production activities and paper based while interest for a telematic procedure only began with legislative decree n 82 of 7 march 2005 cad which is not as relevant in its first version but was later modified by several interventions particularly legislative decree n 335 of 10 december 2013 european sources are also essential the ec and later the european union have undertaken a wide range of actions on e government one of the most important was the launch of the idabc programme and financing for interoperable delivery of european egovernment services to public administrations business and citizens via decision 2004 387 ec of the european parliament and council of 21 april 2004 however the ultimate acknowledgement of the principles of teleadministration with the telematic one stop shop is contained in the directive 2006 123 ec of the european parliament and council of 12 december 2006 on the internal market for services which provides for member states to set up an electronic one stop shop in the wide field of administrative procedures teleadministration and the star procedure this article is not meant to argue the great effect that teleadministration has on the efficiency of administrative activity as we assume that the reader is fully aware that once paper based documents are abandoned the real time flow of documents greatly improves time management and responsibility of the single offices operators while direct online access improves transparency rather this paragraph wants to emphasize how teleadministration promotes maximum usage of the star procedure known and researched in germany as sternverfahren this procedure an alternative to the sequential procedure which has by nature longer head times in the paper based world would require making several copies of the administrative file which can be extremely voluminous for each office and each administration that needs to express an opinion or issue an authorisation with the one stop shop the administration initiating the process is charged with this task electronic files clearly provide evident benefits for these procedures since all involved administrations can directly and simultaneously access the file view the part they need to evaluate and add their opinion or authorisation directly using a star shaped scheme assessing the actual acceptance of teleadministration in current law and real life as a scientific proposition teleadministration sketched the system of telematic administrative procedures well ahead of the law and particularly the electronic one stop shop concept both concepts are based on the dematerialisation of documents and on telematic administrative work the concept of documents dematerialisation ref 9 according to some commentators dematerialization is not the appropriate term for documents that are created in electronic form but rather for those that are created in paper form and are later converted in digital format though conceptually correct this observation ignores the fact that the expression now is generally understood to mean any form that does without the material presence of paper from the creation of the document ref in existence since 1978 as a scientific notion ref 10 see note 1 ref was first embraced in italy law n 59 of 15 march 1997 art 15 para 2 and later by the e c in directive 1999 93 ec once the principle that an electronic document can have legal value was accepted it was possible to deal with its management within a telematic procedure as mentioned configuring this procedure within the rules of teleadministration is today accepted in both european and italian laws european laws also provide quite a detailed description of the electronic one stop shop with rules that fit nicely within the scientific rules of teleadministration their main limitation is that they were specifically designed for the free circulation of services within europe and hence for the procedures these require it is the above mentioned 1996 123 ec directive whose art 6 establishes the one stop shop and art 8 provides that it should be managed remotely and electronically leaving further details to the commission and indeed the commission with its decision of 16 october 2009 provided a number of measures to facilitate the use of electronic procedures through the one stop shop under directive 2006 123 ec these sources are clear and they apply to a wide ranging sector the problem is that any sector or procedure that is not related to the supply of services within the union is not regulated and member states are therefore able to carry on with old fashioned paper based procedures in light of this limitation a group of illustrious european law academics coordinated by giovanni duni has drafted the most effective text for a directive providing a universal system of telematic administrative procedure ref 11 the outcome of this collective research effort is the text for a draft directive that can be found on the cnr ittig journal informatica e diritto vol xxi 2012 n 2 pp 113 129 the telematic procedures in the european union introducing a draft directive as well as on line with an italian and an english language version of the draft on the site http www teleamministrazione it www teleamministrazione it ref italian sources are based on the code of digital administration the above mentioned law decree n 82 of 7 march 2005 in its current version following several modifications which if correctly interpreted and implemented should make it compulsory for all public administrations to use teleadministration thus making the telematic administrative procedure the default procedural method art 14 the key provision establishes that the proceeding administration creates an electronic file to which all involved administrations can and should have access and feed it with the acts of their competence private citizens can also access it under law 241 90 thus the electronic file is the technical and organizational specification of the telematic administrative procedure as it is clear that its creation is an operative stage of the procedure and not simply a new filing system for the archives art 10 of the cad appears at first to be at odds with this interpretation since it establishes that the one stop shop for productive activities provides its services electronically but leaves doubts about the possibility that the back office activities could be still paper based however if art 10 and art 41 are interpreted together the only possible conclusion is that the former is a clarification of front office activities but all the administrative activity is based on the general rule of electronic files and therefore on the teleadministration and the one stop shop compared to european and italian law reality is somewhat behind eight years after directive 1996 123 ce there would be grounds for an infraction procedure against italy but since italy enjoys the company of several other non compliant member states they are all safe for the time being though the letter of the cad may be not be respected it seems very unlikely that this may determine the invalidity or nullity of the acts for violation of art 41 electronic file or art 40 statutory requirement of digital signature because in front of a claim of this nature the administrative judge would apply artt 21 septies and 21 octies of law 241 90 the claimant should demonstrate that the use of the electronic format and electronic file wold have led to a different outcome legal sources us law 1995 utah code paras 46 3 101

some non repudiation schemes offer a time stamp for the digital signature so that even if the private key is exposed the signature is valid digitally signed messages may be anything representable as a bitstring examples include electronic mail contract s or a message sent via some other cryptographic protocol definition of digital signature main article public key cryptography a digital signature scheme typically consists of three algorithms a key generation algorithm that selects a private key uniform distribution discrete uniformly at random from a set of possible private keys the algorithm outputs the private key and a corresponding public key a signing algorithm that given a message and a private key produces a signature a signature verifying algorithm that given the message public key and signature either accepts or rejects the message s claim to authenticity two main properties are required first the authenticity of a signature generated from a fixed message and fixed private key can be verified by using the corresponding public key secondly it should be computationally infeasible to generate a valid signature for a party without knowing that party s private key a digital signature is an authentication mechanism that enables the creator of the message to attach a code that acts as a signature the digital signature algorithm dsa developed by the national institute of standards and technology is one of digital signature some digital signature algorithms many examples of a signing algorithm in the following discussion 1 sup n sup refers to a unary numeral system

such that e nbsp d nbsp modular arithmetic \xe2\x89\xa1 nbsp 1 nbsp mod nbsp \xcf\x86 n where \xcf\x86 is the euler s totient function euler phi function the signer s public key consists of n and e

sup \xe2\x89\xa1 m mod n as noted earlier this basic scheme is not very secure to prevent attacks one can first apply a cryptographic hash function to the message m and then apply the rsa algorithm described above to the result this approach is secure assuming the hash function is a random oracle model random oracle most early signature schemes were of a similar type they involve the use of a trapdoor permutation such as the rsa function or in the case of the rabin signature scheme computing square modulo composite n a trapdoor permutation family is a family of permutation s specified by a parameter that is easy to compute in the forward direction but is difficult to compute in the reverse direction without already knowing the private key trapdoor trapdoor permutations can be used for digital signature schemes where computing the reverse direction with the secret key is required for signing and computing the forward direction is used to verify signatures used directly this type of signature scheme is vulnerable to a key only existential forgery attack to create a forgery the attacker picks a random signature \xcf\x83 and uses the verification procedure to determine the message m corresponding to that signature ref modern cryptography theory practice wenbo mao prentice hall professional technical reference new jersey 2004 pg 308 isbn 0 13 066943 1 ref in practice however this type of signature is not used directly but rather the message to be signed is first cryptographic hash function hashed to produce a short digest that is then signed this forgery attack then only produces the hash function output that corresponds to \xcf\x83 but not a message that leads to that value which does not lead to an attack in the random oracle model this full domain hash hash then sign form of signature is existentially unforgeable even against a chosen plaintext attack ref name lysythesis clarify reason please give a page number or theorem number date september 2010 there are several reasons to sign such a hash or message digest instead of the whole document for efficiency the signature will be much shorter and thus save time since hashing is generally much faster than signing in practice for compatibility messages are typically bit strings but some signature schemes operate on other domains such as in the case of rsa numbers modulo a composite number n a hash function can be used to convert an arbitrary input into the proper format for integrity without the hash function the text to be signed may have to be split separated in blocks small enough for the signature scheme to act on them directly however the receiver of the signed blocks is not able to recognize if all the blocks are present and in the appropriate order notions of security in their foundational paper goldwasser micali and rivest lay out a hierarchy of attack models against digital signatures ref name sjc 17 2 in a key only attack the attacker is only given the public verification key in a known message attack the attacker is given valid signatures for a variety of messages known by the attacker but not chosen by the attacker in an adaptive chosen message attack the attacker first learns signatures on arbitrary messages of the attacker s choice they also describe a hierarchy of attack results ref name sjc 17 2 a total break results in the recovery of the signing key a universal forgery attack results in the ability to forge signatures for any message a selective forgery attack results in a signature on a message of the adversary s choice an existential forgery merely results in some valid message signature pair not already known to the adversary the strongest notion of security therefore is security against existential forgery under an adaptive chosen message attack applications of digital signatures as organizations move away from paper documents with ink signatures or authenticity stamps digital signatures can provide added assurances of the evidence to provenance identity and status of an electronic document as well as acknowledging informed consent and approval by a signatory the united states government printing office gpo publishes electronic versions of the budget public and private laws and congressional bills with digital signatures universities including penn state university of chicago and stanford are publishing electronic student transcripts with digital signatures below are some common reasons for applying a digital signature to communications authentication although messages may often include information about the entity sending a message that information may not be accurate digital signatures can be used to authenticate the source of messages when ownership of a digital signature secret key is bound to a specific user a valid signature shows that the message was sent by that user the importance of high confidence in sender authenticity is especially obvious in a financial context for example suppose a bank s branch office sends instructions to the central office requesting a change in the balance of an account if the central office is not convinced that such a message is truly sent from an authorized source acting on such a request could be a grave mistake integrity in many scenarios the sender and receiver of a message may have a need for confidence that the message has not been altered during transmission although encryption hides the contents of a message it may be possible to change an encrypted message without understanding it some encryption algorithms known as malleability cryptography nonmalleable ones prevent this but others do not however if a message is digitally signed any change in the message after signature invalidates the signature furthermore there is no efficient way to modify a message and its signature to produce a new message with a valid signature because this is still considered to be computationally infeasible by most cryptographic hash functions see collision resistance non repudiation non repudiation ref name cryptomathic majorstandardsdigsig or more specifically non repudiation of origin is an important aspect of digital signatures by this property an entity that has signed some information cannot at a later time deny having signed it similarly access to the public key only does not enable a fraudulent party to fake a valid signature note that these authentication non repudiation etc properties rely on the secret key not having been revoked prior to its usage public revocation of a key pair is a required ability else leaked secret keys would continue to implicate the claimed owner of the key pair checking revocation status requires an online check e g checking a certificate revocation list or via the ref name cryptomathicdigsigservicesashiqja online certificate status protocol very roughly this is analogous to a vendor who receives credit cards first checking online with the credit card issuer to find if a given card has been reported lost or stolen of course with stolen key pairs the theft is often discovered only after the secret key s use e g to sign a bogus certificate for espionage purpose additional security precautions putting the private key on a smart card all public key private key cryptosystems depend entirely on keeping the private key secret a private key can be stored on a user s computer and protected by a local password but this has two disadvantages the user can only sign documents on that particular computer the security of the private key depends entirely on the computer insecurity security of the computer a more secure alternative is to store the private key on a smart card many smart cards are designed to be tamper resistant although some designs have been broken notably by ross j anderson professor ross anderson and his students in a typical digital signature implementation the hash calculated from the document is sent to the smart card whose cpu signs the hash using the stored private key of the user and then returns the signed hash typically a user must activate his smart card by entering a personal identification number or pin code thus providing two factor authentication it can be arranged that the private key never leaves the smart card although this is not always implemented if the smart card is stolen the thief will still need the pin code to generate a digital signature this reduces the security of the scheme to that of the pin system although it still requires an attacker to possess the card a mitigating factor is that private keys if generated and stored on smart cards are usually regarded as difficult to copy and are assumed to exist in exactly one copy thus the loss of the smart card may be detected by the owner and the corresponding certificate can be immediately revoked private keys that are protected by software only may be easier to copy and such compromises are far more difficult to detect using smart card readers with a separate keyboard entering a pin code to activate the smart card commonly requires a numeric keypad some card readers have their own numeric keypad this is safer than using a card reader integrated into a pc and then entering the pin using that computer s keyboard readers with a numeric keypad are meant to circumvent the eavesdropping threat where the computer might be running a keystroke logging keystroke logger potentially compromising the pin code specialized card readers are also less vulnerable to tampering with their software or hardware and are often evaluation assurance level eal3 certified other smart card designs smart card design is an active field and there are smart card schemes which are intended to avoid these particular problems though so far with little security proofs using digital signatures only with trusted applications one of the main differences between a digital signature and a written signature is that the user does not see what he signs the user application presents a hash code to be signed by the digital signing algorithm using the private key an attacker who gains control of the user s pc can possibly replace the user application with a foreign substitute in effect replacing the user s own communications with those of the attacker this could allow a malicious application to trick a user into signing any document by displaying the user s original on screen but presenting the attacker s own documents to the signing application to protect against this scenario an authentication system can be set up between the user s application word processor email client etc and the signing application the general idea is to provide some means for both the user application and signing application to verify each other s integrity for example the signing application may require all requests to come from digitally signed binaries using a network attached hardware security module one of the main differences between a cloud based digital signature service and a locally provided one is risk many risk averse companies including governments financial and medical institutions and payment processors require more secure standards like fips 140 2 level 3 and fips 201 certification to ensure the signature is validated and secure ref http www arx com products privateserver hsm overview privateserver hsm overview ref to finish current and future applications actual algorithms standards why not as adopted as widely as expected etc wysiwys main article wysiwys technically speaking a digital signature applies to a string of bits whereas humans and applications believe that they sign the semantic interpretation of those bits in order to be semantically interpreted the bit string must be transformed into a form that is meaningful for humans and applications and this is done through a combination of hardware and software based processes on a computer system the problem is that the semantic interpretation of bits can change as a function of the processes used to transform the bits into semantic content it is relatively easy to change the interpretation of a digital document by implementing changes on the computer system where the document is being processed from a semantic perspective this creates uncertainty about what exactly has been signed wysiwys what you see is what you sign ref name wysiwys

of and that can be revealed after the signature has been applied wysiwys is a necessary requirement for the validity of digital signatures but this requirement is difficult to guarantee because of the increasing complexity of modern computer systems the term wysiwys was coined by peter landrock and cryptomathic torben pedersen to describe some of the principles in delivering secure and legally binding digital signatures for pan european projects ref name wysiwys seminalpaper digital signatures versus ink on paper signatures an ink signature could be replicated from one document to another by copying the image manually or digitally but to have credible signature copies that can resist some scrutiny is a significant manual or technical skill and to produce ink signature copies that resist professional scrutiny is very difficult digital signatures cryptographically bind an electronic identity to an electronic document and the digital signature cannot be copied to another document paper contracts sometimes have the ink signature block on the last page and the previous pages may be replaced after a signature is applied digital signatures can be applied to an entire document such that the digital signature on the last page will indicate tampering if any data on any of the pages have been altered but this can also be achieved by signing with ink and numbering all pages of the contract some digital signature algorithms rsa algorithm rsa based signature schemes such as rsa pss digital signature algorithm dsa and its elliptic curve cryptography elliptic curve variant elliptic

verifiable a public key associated with bob actually came from bob this is commonly done using a public key infrastructure pki and the public key\xe2\x86\x94user association is attested by the operator of the pki called a certificate authority for open pkis in which anyone can request such an attestation universally embodied in a cryptographically protected identity certificate the possibility of mistaken attestation is non trivial commercial pki operators have suffered several publicly known problems such mistakes could lead to falsely signed and thus wrongly attributed documents closed pki systems are more expensive but less easily subverted in this way only if all of these conditions are met will a digital signature actually be any evidence of who sent the message and therefore of their assent to its contents legal enactment cannot change this reality of the existing engineering possibilities though some such have not reflected this actuality legislatures being importuned by businesses expecting to profit from operating a pki or by the technological avant garde advocating new solutions to old problems have enacted statutes and or regulations in many jurisdictions authorizing endorsing encouraging or permitting digital signatures and providing for or limiting their legal effect the first appears to have been in utah in the united states followed closely by the states massachusetts and california other countries have also passed statutes or issued regulations in this area as well and the un has had an active model law project for some time these enactments or proposed enactments vary from place to place have typically embodied expectations at variance optimistically or pessimistically with the state of the underlying cryptographic engineering and have had the net effect of confusing potential users and specifiers nearly all of whom are not cryptographically knowledgeable adoption of technical standards for digital signatures

note xfa forms have been deprecated from iso 32000 2 in accordance with the outcome of the letter ballot following the pretoria meetings ref technical foundations the pdf combines three technologies a subset of the postscript page description programming language for generating the layout and graphics a font embedding font embedding replacement system to allow fonts to travel with the documents a structured storage system to bundle these elements and any associated content into a single file with data compression where appropriate postscript postscript is a page description language run in an interpreter computing interpreter to generate an image a process requiring many resources it can handle graphics and standard features of programming language s such as code if code and code loop code commands pdf is largely based on postscript but simplified to remove flow control features like these while graphics commands such as code lineto code remain often the postscript like pdf code is generated from a source postscript file the graphics commands that are output by the postscript code are collected and lexical analysis tokenized any files graphics or fonts to which the document refers also are collected then everything is compressed to a single file therefore the entire postscript world fonts layout measurements remains intact as a document format pdf has several advantages over postscript pdf contains tokenized and interpreted results of the postscript source code for direct correspondence between changes to items in the pdf page description and changes to the resulting page appearance pdf from version 1 4 supports transparency graphic graphic transparency postscript does not postscript is an interpreted programming language with an implicit global state so instructions accompanying the description of one page can affect the appearance of any following page therefore all preceding pages in a postscript document must be processed to determine the correct appearance of a given page whereas each page in a pdf document is unaffected by the others as a result pdf viewers allow the user to quickly jump to the final pages of a long document whereas a postscript viewer needs to process all pages sequentially before being able to display the destination page unless the optional postscript document structuring conventions have been carefully complied with technical overview file structure a pdf file is a 7 bit ascii file except for certain elements that may have binary content a pdf file starts with a header containing the magic number programming

indirect indirect objects are numbered with an object number and a generation number and defined between the code obj code and code endobj code keywords an index table also called the cross reference table and marked with the code xref code keyword follows the main body and gives the byte offset of each indirect object from the start of the file ref adobe systems pdf reference pp 39 40 ref this design allows for efficient random access to the objects in the file and also allows for small changes to be made without rewriting the entire file incremental update beginning with pdf version 1 5 indirect objects may also be located in special streams known as object streams this technique reduces the size of files that have large numbers of small indirect objects and is especially useful for tagged pdf at the end of a pdf file is a trailer introduced with the code trailer code keyword it contains a dictionary an offset to the start of the cross reference table the table starting with the code xref code keyword and the code eof code end of file marker the dictionary contains a reference to the root object of the tree structure also known as the catalog the count of indirect objects in the cross reference table and other optional information there are two layouts to the pdf files non linear not optimized and linear optimized non linear pdf files consume less disk space than their linear counterparts though they are slower to access because portions of the data required to assemble pages of the document are scattered throughout the pdf file linear pdf files also called

very similar to that of postscript except for the use of transparency graphic transparency which was added in pdf 1 4 pdf graphics use a device independence device independent cartesian coordinate system to describe the surface of a page a pdf page description can use a matrix mathematics matrix to scale ratio scale rotate or shear mapping skew graphical elements a key concept in pdf is that of the graphics state which is a collection of graphical parameters that may be changed saved and restored by a page description pdf has as of version 1 6 24 graphics state properties of which some of the most important are the current transformation matrix ctm which determines the coordinate system the clipping path the color space the alpha compositing alpha constant which is a key component of transparency vector graphics as in postscript vector graphics in pdf are constructed with paths paths are usually composed of lines and cubic b\xc3\xa9zier curve s but can also be constructed from the outlines of text unlike postscript pdf does not allow a single path to mix text outlines with lines and curves paths can be stroked filled or used for clipping path clipping strokes and fills can use any color set in the graphics state including patterns pdf supports several types of patterns the simplest is the tiling pattern in which a piece of artwork is specified to be drawn repeatedly this may be a colored tiling pattern with the colors specified in the pattern object or an uncolored tiling pattern which defers color specification to the time the pattern is drawn beginning with pdf 1 3 there is also a shading pattern which draws continuously varying colors there are seven types of shading pattern of which the simplest are the axial shade type 2 and radial shade type 3 pictures desperately needed here raster images raster graphics raster images in pdf called image xobjects are represented by dictionaries with an associated stream the dictionary describes properties of the image and the stream contains the image data less commonly a raster image may be embedded directly in a page description as an inline image images are typically filtered for compression purposes image filters supported in pdf include the general purpose filters ascii85decode a filter used to put the stream into 7 bit ascii asciihexdecode similar to ascii85decode but less compact flatedecode a commonly used filter based on the deflate algorithm defined in rfc 1951 deflate is also used in the gzip portable network graphics png and zip file format zip file formats among others introduced in

the characters is to be preserved transparency the original imaging model of pdf was like postscript s opaque each object drawn on the page completely replaced anything previously marked in the same location in pdf 1 4 the imaging model was extended to allow transparency when transparency is used new objects interact with previously marked objects to produce blending effects the addition of transparency to pdf was done by means of new extensions that were designed to be ignored in products written to the pdf 1 3 and earlier specifications as a result files that use a small amount of transparency might view acceptably in older viewers but files making extensive use of transparency could be viewed incorrectly in an older viewer without warning the transparency extensions are based on the key concepts of transparency groups blending modes shape and alpha the model is closely aligned with the features of adobe illustrator version 9 the blend modes were based on those used by adobe photoshop at the time when the pdf 1 4 specification was published the formulas for calculating blend modes were kept secret by adobe they have since been published ref https www adobe com

text and graphics out of the document modifying the document or adding or modifying text notes and acroforms acroform fields the user password controls opening encrypts the file and requires password cracking to defeat with difficulty depending on password strength and encryption method it is potentially very secure assuming good password and encryption method without known attacks the owner password controls operations does not encrypt the file and instead relies on client software to respect these restrictions and is not secure an owner password can be removed by many commonly available

titles until 1919 he presented each year in the official order of precedence the list of members of the royal family of france the princes of blood and the main body of the kingdom great crown officers senior clerics abbots of large abbeys with income of each abbey marshals of france colonels and general officers ambassadors and consuls of france presidents of the main courts state councilors bankers etc despite the fact that he could present indigestible because of the many lists that he was composed he enjoyed a wide circulation with a readership consisting primarily of financial political and all persons who had an interest in knowing the administrative organization of france although his edition is due to the initiative of a private publisher included in the lists of the almanac was a royal official and abuse were therefore punished thus a poitou poitevin pierre joly was interned in the bastille at the end of the eighteenth century to have usurped the banking profession by being registered as such in the almanach royal his edition was in regular format in 8 o editor with a binder leather adorned with a sprinkling of fleur de lys gold history founded at the request of king laurent d houry imagines a calendar or almanac 1683 the first edition contained only a few pages with a calendar and omens for the coming year the last edition in this form in 1699 already shows some lists that foreshadow the upcoming royal almanac thus we find lists of counselors of state with their ordinary homes the commissioners of the board auditors general and stewards of finances the chancellor archbishops and bishops of france universities and the list of major exhibitions sessions of the courts of paris and the log of the palace and finally addresses the messengers and items indicating the day of departure in 1699 louis xiv asked him what the author describes in detail his work here as his widow explains these beginnings louis xiv who wanted this glorious memory almanac made him ask the author who had the honor to present to her majesty s what induced him to give the title of royal almanac to make it his principal occupation of this work the same year louis tribouillet chaplain of the king and canon of meaux publishes its state of france this book describes in detail the functioning of the court of the king all his ministers the treatments they receive the various expenses of the state clergy etc the first edition of the almanac royal appears in 1700 at the same time as another book calendar of the court of john colombat one of the printers of the king parisians have a choice between three books with similar content the almanach royal houry calendar of the court of colombat and the state of france tribouillet at that time the yard around louis xiv is highly stratified and since the expansion of the palace of versailles in 1684 it continues to grow in this context recognition of peers is a valuable asset if someone has just placed a new post is an overflow of praise in its favor during the floods and the chapel but c is that while envy and jealousy talk like adulation one can understand the need to maintain directories so that everyone can follow the evolution of all these people the multiplicity of these publications so says the king s will want to officially referencing his courtier s to charges created to keep beside him at palace of versailles versailles and maintain the jealousies of each other even if the king gave his approval publishing such a book is not without risk in december 1708 laurent d houry is being prosecuted for having established a printing press in his house and forced to sell its equipment two months later then in february 1716 he was imprisoned in the bastille on complaint of the earl of stair the british ambassador to be disrespectful in his almanac the king george by not naming him not as king of england or rather from great britain and mention the king as son of jacques ii stuart exiled to st germain affirmation of a monopoly the almanac and the royal court calendar coexist peacefully for ten years and a lot of money to their authors but from 1710 laurent d houry integrates more and more topics like the book colombat biblio the abscess broke out in 1717 when houry almanac releases its abstract that will follow the format of the calendar of the court and simultaneously filing a lawsuit against its competitor a judgement of solomon is made if it is allowed to houry now to continue the publication of its abstract and to counterfeit the court calendar colombat is obliged to freeze its calendar format and forbidden expand content this stops any changes in the calendar of the court leaving the way open to the almanac upon the death of laurent houry in 1725 his family is destitute revenues from sales of the almanac are not sufficient to cover expenses of printing and bookselling in these circumstances his widow elizabeth dubois took over the business their son charles maurice who had hitherto been a mere proofreader of the almanac is trying to evict her mother and she is suing cons it prepares the edition of 1726 but a ruling forbade him to publish it in his name alone the ruling of 11 december 1726 forbids even disturb the affairs of his mother and to participate directly or indirectly to the development of the almanac that is why charles maurice is mentioned as editor of the almanac on the edition of 1726 in 1731 she filed a new lawsuit against colombat which increased its schedule despite the prohibition of 1717 unsuccessful she resumed the publication of the abstract and colombat complaint in turn she then accepts to abandon the publication of the abstract if returned to colombat format from 1718 the disputes have become extinct with the death of the parties the privilege of the almanac is about to expire charles maurice d houry tries one last time to seize it but a royal letter of 27 march 1744 confirmed definitively andr\xc3\xa9 fran\xc3\xa7ois le breton as sole heir a family of hegemony 131 years directorate of andr\xc3\xa9 le breton in 1728 the widow of his grandson houry combines son andr\xc3\xa9 fran\xc3\xa7ois le breton who was 18 years old and an orphan under the guardianship of charles maurice d houry andrew francis had inherited according to the will of the estate of lawrence houry half of the rights of the almanac and his widow the rest under his leadership the almanac takes a new breath and adds new sections which sometimes does not go without punishment for example in 1768 he has trouble with voltaire who sent him a letter incendiary i say as much to le breton the almanach royal printer i ll pay him almanac point that sold me this year he had the rudeness to say that mr president mr advisor remains in the cul de sac to menard in the cul de sac of the white coats in the ass de sac de l orangerie how can you say that president remains in a serious ass in 1773 le breton moved his print shop in a wing of the former hotel d alegre at 13 rue de hautefeuille he acquired william louis joly de fleury and was previously occupied by ambassador portugal in the late eighteenth century the weather is bad and bad wheat harvests the price of this staple increases disproportionately recently a rumor that the government would have the monopoly wheat thus perpetuating the high cost of food this rumor became official when accidentally in his edition of 1774 le breton added a treasurer s grain account of the king in the person of sr mirlavaud the edition of the almanac had yet been proofread and approved by the chancellor but was still sentenced to close his shop for 3 months and publish a revised edition without the line in question in 1777 le breton was again accused of inserting information deemed subversive it has according to its critics cited the floral pranks verg\xc3\xa8s vaucresson among the prosecutors and attorneys general of the parliament of paris who had been involved in a reform of parliament made by maupeou against the venality of parliament desired by louis xv but annulled by louis xvi in rebuke le breton was sentenced to carton section on the almanacs that had not yet been sold and replacement cost the almanac issue of those who so request it he died on 4 october 1779 and his cousin charles laurent houry son of charles maurice d houry took over the business french revolution the privilege granted to the family of houry for the almanac has been threatened in 1789 when camille desmoulins in his speech at the lantern to the parisians says it will cease in favor of baldwin another parisian publisher this threat has not been brought into effect since the almanac remained in houry looking at the publications of the time we can nevertheless see that baldwin got the impressions of the national assembly french revolution national assembly and other organs of state last generation houry following the death of joan nera widow of laurent charles houry the almanac is echoed by jean fran\xc3\xa7ois no\xc3\xabl debure husband of anne charlotte d houry their daughter debure is from a prominent and wealthy family of parisian booksellers especially combined with the didot family it is a printer since 1784 with the title s printer duke of orleans debure takes time printing of the family of houry but his other business is in trouble and he is forced to file for bankruptcy to keep the property inherited from his family anne charlotte d houry hires a separation procedure in november 1791 the bankruptcy is declared and it is opposed to the creditor s to preserve his legacy and this opposition is futile and a ruling allows creditors to seize his furniture but that does not appear to have been necessary because a subsequent decision allows him to recover property that creditors have not taken her husband francois jean noel debure dies 1802 in loiret however it is focused died from 1795 through various sources maybe it was just left without leaving an address stephen lawrence testu worked as a clerk in the family home debure since 1788 and had gradually won the confidence of the household because of the absence of mr debure anne charlotte is alone with his two son despite their age difference he is 20 years younger than she she married testu july 1795 testu few highlights its knowledge in the profession to convince him to transfer the management of printing it accepts in 1797 and offered him priority over the rights of the almanac in exchange for a perpetual annuity european financial arrangements annuity of 800 francs then she completely abandons the almanac this influx of money seems to turn the head testu who play games and learn to enjoy the easy life neglects the direction of its establishment and constantly running out of money he contracted many loans that gradually ruining his business relations were strained with his wife because he left the marital home in september 1801 and the only ties that bind the couple are now linked to multiple trials they s intentent in 1810 testu secretly sold the rights of the almanac in which he partnered with guyot anne charlotte d houry opposes this sale she saw as a usurpation but loses the case in 1812 she gets in return a pension of 1 200 francs testu does not pay indeed a decree of 1820 declares the debtor more than 90 000 francs in 1814 due to the large sums invested by guyot in the case an order confirming the owner of the almanac a copy of this order is also printed at the end of the following books testu still gets guyot repayment of its debts and an annuity of 2 400 francs guyot dismisses testu business in 1820 and continues even to pay his annuity the latter again running out of money turned in 1823 against his wife calls it reaches the marital home and she pays all household expenses or alternatively that she pays rent of 6000 francs judges d\xc3\xa9boutent testu the marital home since he himself had deserted 22 years earlier and has no housing to offer his wife even though she already lives in a very beautiful but still require his wife yet very rich to pay him a pension of 1 800 francs by invoking the solidarity between spouses the hegemony of the family of houry on the almanac established in 1683 has finally ceased in 1814 when by order the company is transferred to the association guyot testu anne charlotte d houry died 22 july 1828 aged about 83 years judgement of publishing in 1867 edition of the almanac is transferred to the widow berger levrault who had already published the yearbook of the french empire diplomatic and military yearbook of the french empire both published as the almanac according to documents provided by the administration the edition of the almanac stops definitively in 1919 after four years of interruption due to war the latter number includes the years 1915 to 1919 not found in the literature the reasons that prompted the shutdown of publication but it can be assumed that the combination of very large volume of the book more than 1650 pages in 1900 and the hard times that the economics and french policy at that time was to make the management of such a volume of information extremely complex and unprofitable for the publisher it is also possible that the new government formed after elections in 1919 no longer supported the development of the almanac changing content the topics in the almanac the almanac or calendar as he was called in its early editions was just a simple calendar which were associated topics on astronomical events the days of fairs the newspaper of the palace the residence of messengers the departure of the mails the price of currencies and the list of collectors offices after his presentation to the king in 1699 many items are constantly being added including the clergy the royal family of france then the families of other sovereign nations officers ambassadors etc in 1705 houry added to the list of knights of the holy spirit and peer and marshal of france in 1707 it is the state of the clergy and in 1712 the birth of kings princes and princesses of europe after the death of louis xiv the duke of orleans became the regent is added to the list of members of the royal family of the members of the house of orleans later he put more of his own the full house of the queen and princes it is not possible to describe all items contained in an almanac as there so the contents of 1780 covers ten pages the almanac also stands abreast of scientific advances in the middle of the eighteenth century improving the accuracy of clocks and many wealthy fans begin to observe and study the stars it is indispensable to know precisely the difference between true solar time of sundial s and mean solar time clocks especially since the advent of clocks seconds this is the equation of the pendulum also called the equation of time the table is added shortly before 1750 with the french revolution the almanac exchange of title and its content is modified to match the new institutions the abolition of all distinctions requires overhaul the topics timing of the vulgar era is replaced by the french republican calendar republican calendar the place reserved for kings and princes of europe is replaced by a note on the friendly powers of france the administrative organs of royal power are replaced by new ministries the content changes again with the reforms of the consulate and the empire the restoration the hundred days the july monarchy the french second republic second republic followed the second french empire second empire and the french third republic third republic who sees the end of the edition of almanac in each case the bindings are supplied with the times as the number of entries is increasing the number of pages follows the same trend they numbered one hundred in 1699 nearly five hundred in 1760 and seven hundred just before the french revolution the course of a thousand pages is taken in 1840 to over 1000 6 cents in 1900 on average about thirty names are listed per page the total number of people or places listed annually in the tens of thousands but no table patronymic does quickly find a particular name all changes in the almanac makes it a very useful book for historians that may follow year after year ministries and other administrative bodies movements of people in these offices and retail organization public services to a resident of paris such as places of mailboxes timetables and fares for ticks and royal messengers chronology of the 237 years of publishing almanacs after the death of laurent houry his descendants continued his work until 1814 the edition was continued until 1919 it would be tedious to describe in words the evolution of the almanac of the 237 years that have elapsed since the first edition by laurent d houry in 1683 hence the choice of this table layout throughout its existence the almanac has crossed 11 schemes political editor changed the title 14 times and 9 times publication collecting information since its inception in 1700 following a royal demand the almanac invented by laurent d houry aims to be an official handbook until the french revolution contributors are cordially invited to provide information to the bookseller as pointed note of the printer in the first pages of the almanac in 1771 for example we read in the journal history of the revolution that the bar association in the person of a certain gerbier asserted that there would be no change in the order of the table and that it would be printed in the almanac as royal was last year leaving out only the dead with the french revolution the order was given to government to provide all information to the publisher in 1802 testu gets even exclusivity later the collection of information for the almanac is even part of the operating budget of the ministries and can be seen in order of december 31 1844 signed by louis philippe i on the organization of the ministry administration navy article 6 of which list the items in the budget the formation of the royal almanac typography the print quality improves significantly when laurent d houry became printer it multiplies the bands and tail lights to decorate and titles for sections the almanac is still very poor prints because the image is not its goal only that the reader can find are patterns explaining the oppositions of the planets and eclipses are present every year and the map of departments of france editions of 1791 and 1792 despite the short time to prepare the book the printer treats the presentation and uses in the case of many variations in size and shape of characters for easy reading of long lists special characters to emphasize certain lines compositions tables or columns and clusters in braces that le breton grand son of laurent houry who brings more to the book it increases greatly and restructures the almanac and also improves its presentation in order to preserve readability many notes are added to guide the reader and help in understanding the operation of certain administrative bodies the almanacs modern nineteenth century advantage of technological advances cartoon characters are modernized and the use of fonts to graphics customizable multiplies sometimes to excess we can count at least 7 in 11 fonts fonts differ on the cover page of the national almanac 1850 printed by guyot et scribe announcements the ancestors of advertising are introduced by the publisher berger levrault in the late nineteenth century well to shoot the deadline for submitting this information to the editor is set to first ten days of october or november the last minute changes are incorporated in an erratum end of the book when they are too large they may even delay the release in late december an event is sent to the administration for approving the content this approval is required before the sale it leaves only two months to integrate the information of the year in the text of the previous edition and call all of the pages before submitting the book for the right to shoot the editing step at least for the test in 1706 has not been done with great care as can be seen by very many shells and mistakes which have crept into the table of contents presented in thumbnail to the right once the administrative agreement obtained it is inserted end of the book the almanac is stapled or bound and is then distributed to customers at the end of the year printing early almanacs were not printed by laurent d houry the almanac of 1706 and is printed by jacques vincent installed huchette street at the sign of the angel november 15 1712 laurent houry became printer and immediately began printing his work then all the almanacs will be printed by their publishers draw there is no source that explains the draw of the almanac the only figures available are the annual rents generated by sales in 1782 mercier said a pension of more than 40 000 francs diderot at the same time puts the figure at 30 000 pounds for a price of sale of 5 to 6 pounds the draw must necessarily be greater than about 7500 almanacs around 1820 during the trials that have brought the widow and debure testu income of the almanac was estimated between 25 and 30 000 francs in 1834 another almanac the almanac of france said that its cost is 35 cents for a sale price of 50 cents booksellers then purchase the item at prices of 38 cents to resell a suggested retail price of 50 cents the publisher earns so 3 cents per pound sold the bookseller earns 12 minus shipping costs dependent if one considers arbitrarily a four almanac is sold directly into the library testu priced at 10 francs 50 the remainder being passed through intermediaries we can prorate that to generate an annual income of 30 000 francs testu must sell approximately 25 000 in the absence of more precise information we can only estimate at about 15 000 the number of copies sold per year between the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century binding the almanac is sold either stapled or bound by the printer the paperback version allows the purchaser to connect his book as he wishes and so it is possible to find books with bindings very ornate with lace weapons of families many colors brightened or gilding biblio 24 etc the bound version provided by the printer is usually presented in a bound in calf or morocco clarify date august 2012 full and lilies in the boxes back with the revolution the lilies are replaced with phrygian caps in roundels library 25 distribution the almanac is normally available from the bookseller but it can also be found in the province in other bookstores that serve as intermediaries for example in 1816 at pesche bookseller at le mans ref 17 or by correspondence through the sorbonne as did voltaire ref 18 readership the almanac has a very great interest because of the number of subjects it addresses the organization of the french administration in 1785 mairobert wrote that the almanach royal is in the hands of everyone and is among the princes the king s office the foreign ministers would cater ref 19 louis sebastien mercier in a pamphlet the tableau de paris that stands in 1782 ref 20 explains that those who are thrown into the paths of ambition study almanac royal with serious attention more a beautiful royal consult the almanac to see if her lover is a lieutenant or sergeant that everyone is buying the almanac to find out exactly where they stand and finally even fontenelle said that it was the book which contained the greatest truths adages use the almanac as a reference according to jean fran\xc3\xa7ois de la harpe is the only book to read to get rich is the royal almanac ref 21 jean joseph regnault warin uses the phrase having the memory of a royal almanac ref 22 or the memoirs of the academy of hawkers ref 23 explains that it is enough to read the almanac for education in the eyes of justice the book can be used as a basis for comparison during a police investigation in 1824 ref 24 a defendant defends himself by explaining that the volume of documents he was accused of having carried could be equal to that of a royal almanac almanac or a related trade whether to have a certain level of resources to purchase this item the customer extended beyond the financial and political world competition the royal almanac is competing at its inception with the almanac of the court of colombat who can not make it evolve since 1717 in fact bibliographers consider that the royal almanac is one of the oldest and most helpful ref 25 if it essentially describes the royal court and the parisian institutions other major cities also have their almanacs such as the city of lyon equally voluminous ref 26 the almanac is however considered a reference book in 1780 a notice of a bookseller named desnos inserted at the end of the gazette of 27 offers for courts ref 8 pounds to the statesman letters and generally all persons attached to the service of the king almanach royal calendar of the court said colombat mignone strennas note 22 ref 28 the state military note 23 the four connected units with shelves stylus to write which makes the closure the royal almanac ranks first in the collection the court calendar since 1717 the calendar of the court can not change its sections are limited to an ephemeris of the celestial motions 30 years increased by astronomical tables with sky conditions and timing of the court to the family and royal house lists of boards departments and secretaries of state finances births and deaths of kings queens princes and princesses of europe the knights of various orders the archbishops and bishops of the kingdom and cardinals of the sacred college it is primarily sought for its ephemeris of the celestial motions and astronomical tables of events the almanac of commerce the almanac of business published by s\xc3\xa9bastien bottin in the eighteenth century contains besides the addresses of shops in paris many useful statistics financiers it is supplementary to the almanach royal which concerns only the french administration the state of france some have criticized the almanach royal of being a plagiarism of the state of france another administrative directory the first publication seems to have been made in 1619 and is still published in the middle of the eighteenth century ref 30 however the edition of 1736 of the state of france said it was a periodical whose audience has applied for renewal from time to time and had been published until 1699 1702 1708 1712 1718 and 1727 ref 31 the latest editions of 1727 and 1736 five volumes contain over 500 pages each offices are described down to the smallest detail note 25 the state of france is a companion volume of the almanach royal use by those who wish to deepen their knowledge on the functioning of the french administration examples of information contained in the almanac further details concerning the organization of the administration of the french state and persons who occupied positions many other topics are discussed in the almanacs for example in the eighteenth century the cost of construction in paris this section is only found in the almanacs of the early eighteenth century and stops just before 1726 there are prices for masonry carpentry and joinery roofing locksmithing painting and glazing that are usually in paris for example walls of circular pits with layers of stone studded with low excess moilon quilted 18 inch thick 22 pounds fquare fathom and more in proportion to the depth of the wells or other difficulties that may encounter with these data the historian is able to quantify fully the construction of a building in paris at that time the official ceremonies the almanac explains in great detail some official ceremonies opening ceremony of the annual courthouse the entry of parliament is the day after the s martin 12 november which day presidents in red dresses holding their furs mortar note 26 gowns gentlemen consultants red after attending the solemn mass that are usually said by a bishop in the grand hall of the palace receive oaths of lawyers counsel the first president made this day a speech to thank those who celebrated the mass which responds to him by another harangue note 27 procession of the university whose description takes three pages of the almanac note 28 the rector of the university at the end of its rector who regularly is only three months indicating a general procession which assists the whole body it is a ceremony that deserves to be seen we will mark the place here what the doctors take the four faculties note 29 that comprise the university all the graduates of these faculties with the religious orders note 30 procession from the church of religious trinitarians otherwise known as maturin the procession is closed by the booksellers papermakers bookbinders parcherminiers illuminators writers swear by the university the detailed description of the ceremonies to stop mid eighteenth century to make room for a still more comprehensive directory a reference is then made towards the end of the book guides for all kinds of ceremonies to be observed in the receipt of any office or employment whether in dress or in the sword transportation transportation of persons is ensured by the coaches carriages wagons and other carriages found in the almanac schedules and rates of major roads in 1715 a passenger wishing to travel from paris to caen will go rue saint denis on monday at six o clock in the morning he has previously sent his clothes the night before early fifteen years later the starting time is advanced to 5 am in summer and in 1750 the departure is 5 hours throughout the year in 1780 two flights are scheduled tuesdays and fridays at 23 30 and the journey takes two days a van slower except sunday at noon and made the trip in four and a half days in summer and five days in winter in 1790 transportation is now provided by the general department of stagecoaches and mail royal france three coaches liaise on tuesday thursday and sunday and the van on sunday the departure is now notre dame des victoires rates are rarely reported but in 1725 and 1761 is 18 pounds per person tournaments he is 21 pounds in 1770 to reach 42 pounds in 1790 fortunately for the traveler it is stated that the sleeping bag weighing 10 pounds is free company guards of the king pumps in 1716 the king appoints fran\xc3\xa7ois perrier dumouriez as director general of public pump to remedy fire without the audience is obliged to pay anything in 1722 he founded the compagnie des gardes pumps du roy under the direction of the same this company later became the brigade of firefighters in paris note 32 the almanac of 1719 lists these pumps and their wardens and deputy wardens we then learned that a brigade is made up of four guards and four sub custodians who are responsible for maintaining the material deposited in each district what became three years later the society of king s guards pumps were not at that time that 41 people 17 pumps distributed in groups of 8 men and 4 or 3 pumps in the city hall the convent of the grands augustins the carmelite convent in the place maubert convent of mercy and the fathers of little place des victoires in addition to a pump at the director general of the pumps rue mazarine except dumouriez guards pumps are not professional fire but shoemakers carpenters locksmiths etc considerations bibliophiles availability almanacs are found regularly in auctions and in the antiquarian booksellers given their importance documentary and the fact that there are beautiful copies these books are particularly sought after by historians writers bibliophiles and enthusiasts volumes in the first round of the seventeenth century often exceed several thousand euros ref 32 the other is generally negotiated between a few tens and five hundred euros sometimes more depending on their rarity condition and quality bookbinding note 33 just over half are however available for free download on gallica or google books notes handwritten readers almanacs contain some handwritten notes left by their readers the value of the book can then be influenced upward or downward depending on the quality and content of these notes and especially the person who wrote them when you can identify it they are usually found on page intentionally left blank for the ephemeris some of these notes can provide very interesting information such as notes written on the page in august 1715 a copy of the bnf it relates the circumstances of the death of louis xiv who was suffering from gangrene note 34 we thought the death dez

b'cleanup date march 2011 a web query topic classification categorization is a problem in information science the task is to assign a web search query to one or more predefined categorization categories based on its topics the importance of query classification is underscored by many services provided by web search a direct application is to provide better search result pages for users with interests of different categories for example the users issuing a web query apple might expect to see web pages related to the fruit apple or they may prefer to see products or news related to the computer company online advertisement services can rely on the query classification results to promote different products more accurately search result pages can be grouped according to the categories predicted by a query classification algorithm however the computation of query classification is non trivial different from the document classification tasks queries submitted by web search users are usually short and ambiguous also the meanings of the queries are evolving over time therefore query topic classification is much more difficult than traditional document classification tasks kddcup 2005 kddcup 2005 competition ref http www kdd org kdd cup view kdd cup 2005 kddcup 2005 dataset ref highlighted the interests in query classification the objective of this competition is to classify 800 000 real user queries into 67 target categories each query can belong to more than one target category as an example of a qc task given the query apple it should be classified into ranked categories computers hardware living food cooking class wikitable query categories apple computers hardware br living food cooking fifa 2006 sports soccer br sports schedules tickets br entertainment games toys cheesecake recipes living food cooking br information arts humanities friendships poem information arts humanities br living dating relationships image web query length gif image web query meaning gif difficulties web query topic classification is to automatically assign a query to some predefined categories different from the traditional document classification tasks there are several major difficulties which hinder the progress of web query understanding how to derive an appropriate feature representation for web queries many queries are short and query terms are noisy as an example in the kddcup 2005 dataset queries containing 3 words are most frequent 22 furthermore 79 queries have no more than 4 words a user query often has multiple meanings for example apple can mean a kind of fruit or a computer company java can mean a programming language or an island in indonesia in the kddcup 2005 dataset most of the queries contain more than one meaning therefore only using the keywords of the query to set up a vector space model for classification is not appropriate query enrichment based methods ref shen et al http www sigkdd org sites default files issues 7 2 2005 12

query enrichment for web query classification acm tois vol 24 no 3 july 2006 ref start by enriching user queries to a collection of text documents through search engines thus each query is represented by a pseudo document which consists of the snippets of top ranked result pages retrieved by search engine subsequently the text documents are classified into the target categories using synonym based classifier or statistical classifiers such as naive bayes nb and support vector machines svms how about disadvantages and advantages give the answers how to adapt the changes of the queries and categories over time the meanings of queries may also evolve over time therefore the old labeled training queries may be out of data and useless soon how to make the classifier adaptive over time becomes a big issue for example the word barcelona has a new meaning of the new micro processor of amd while it refers to a city or football club before 2007 the distribution of the meanings of this term is therefore a function of time on the web intermediate taxonomy based method ref shen et al http portal acm org ft gateway cfm id 1148196 building bridges for web query classification acm sigir 2006 ref first builds a bridging classifier on an intermediate taxonomy such as open directory project odp in an offline mode this classifier is then used in an online mode to map user queries to the

b'a sponsored search auction ssa also known as a keyword auction is an indispensable part of the business model of modern web host s it refers to results from a search engine that are not output by the main search algorithm but rather clearly separate advertisements paid for by third parties these advertisements are typically related to the terms for which the user searched they come in the form of a link and some information with the hope that a search user will click on the link and buy something from the advertiser in sponsored search auctions there are typically some fixed number of slots for advertisements and more advertisers that want these slots than there are slots the advertisers have different valuations for these slots and slots are a scarce resource so an auction is done to determine how the slots will be assigned history prior to 1998 many advertisements were charged by impression as it was the easiest metric to calculate in 1998 goto com inc debuted a pay per click charging system with pricing and slot placement determined by an auction goto used a first price auction where bidders were placed according to their bids and charged their bids when they won goto faced bidders who were constantly changing their bid in response to new information and changing information from other bidders currently charging per action is a common pricing scheme in affiliate networks such as the amazon associates program in 2002 google adwords began using a second price auction to sell the single advertisement slot shortly thereafter pages had multiple advertisements slots which were allocated and sold via generalized second price auction gsp auction the natural generalization of a second price single item multi bidder auction ref hal varian christopher harris the vcg auction in theory and practice in the american economic review volume 104 issue 5 pages 442 452 elsevier b v 2014 ref auction mechanisms generalized second price auction generalized second price auction gsp is the most commonly used auction mechanism for sponsored search untruthfulness an issue with gsp is that it s not a truthful auction and it is not the optimal strategy to illustrate this consider the following example there are three bidders with only two possible slots the values of each bidders 1 2 and 3 are 10 5 and 3 respectively suppose that the first slot click through rate ctr is 300 and the second slot ctr is 290 if bidder 1 is truthful he would have to pay math p 1 5 300 1500 math for a utility of math u 1 10 300 1500 1500 math however if bidder 1 decides to lie and reports a value of 4 instead then his utility would be math u 2 10 290 3 290 2030 math notice that math u 2 u 1 math which makes gsp untruthful and bidders have an incentive to lie quality variant google uses a minor variant of gsp to auction off advertisement slots potential advertisements may be of varying quality suppose that there are two advertisements for eggs one advertisement simply fills its space with the word egg repeated over and over while the other advertisement shows a picture of eggs contains branding information and mentions positive qualities about their eggs such as cage freeness the second advertisement may be thought of as having higher quality than the first advertisement being more useful to consumers more likely to be clicked on and more likely to generate revenue for both the advertiser and google advertisements that have a history of high click through rates are geographically targeted at the user or have a high quality landing page may also be thought of as having higher quality ref google adwords check and understand quality score support google com adwords answer 2454010 ref google assigns a numeric quality score math gamma i math to each bidder math i math bidders rather than being ordered purely by their bid are instead ordered by rank which is the product of their bid and quality score math gamma 1 b 1 geq gamma 2 b 2 geq dots geq gamma n b n math slots are still assigned in decreasing rank order bidders are charged rather than the bid of the bidder one rank lower math p i b i b i b i 1 math are charged the minimum price for which if it was their bid would keep them in their current rank math p i b i b i frac gamma i 1 b i 1 gamma i math vickrey clarke groves auction vickrey clarke groves auction vcg is a truthful auction optimizing social welfare vcg is more complicated to explain than gsp and that might deter many websites from using a vcg auction mechanism even though it s truthful however some websites use vcg as their auction mechanism most notably facebook see also generalized second price auction vickrey clarke groves auction references reflist category internet search'

redirection also called url forwarding is a world wide web technique for making a web page available under more than one uniform resource locator url address when a web browser attempts to open a url that has been redirected a page with a different url is opened similarly domain redirection or domain forwarding is when all pages in a url domain name domain are redirected to a different domain as when http www wikipedia com wikipedia com and http www wikipedia net wikipedia net are automatically redirected to http www wikipedia org wikipedia org url redirection is done for various reasons for url shortening to prevent link rot broken links when web pages are moved to allow multiple domain names belonging to the same owner to refer to a single website web site to guide navigation into and out of a website for privacy protection and for less innocuous purposes such as phishing attacks purposes there are several reasons to use url redirection similar domain names a user might mistype a url for example example com and exmaple com organizations often register these misspelled domains and redirect them to the correct location example com the addresses example com and example net could both redirect to a single domain or web page such as example org this technique is often used to reserve other top level domain s tld with the same name or make it easier for a true edu or net to redirect to a more recognizable com domain moving pages to a new domain web pages may be redirected to a new domain for three reasons a site might desire or need to change its domain name an author might move his or her individual pages to a new domain two web sites might merge with url redirects incoming links to an outdated url can be sent to the correct location these links might be from other sites that have not realized that there is a change or from bookmarks favorites that users have saved in their browsers the same applies to search engine s they often have the older outdated domain names and links in their database and will send search users to these old urls by using a moved permanently redirect to the new url visitors will still end up at the correct page also in the next search engine pass the search engine should detect and use the newer url logging outgoing links the access logs of most web servers keep detailed information about where visitors came from and how they browsed the hosted site they do not however log which links visitors left by this is because the visitor s browser has no need to communicate with the original server when the visitor clicks on an outgoing link this information can be captured in several ways one way involves url redirection instead of sending the visitor straight to the other site links on the site can direct to a url on the original website s domain that automatically redirects to the real target this technique bears the downside of the delay caused by the additional request to the original website s server as this added request will leave a trace in the server log revealing exactly which link was followed it can also be a privacy issue ref cite journal title google revives redirect snoopery journal blog anta

ref that exploited the nature of the search engine s handling for temporary redirects if a temporary redirect is encountered search engines have to decide whether they assign the ranking value to the url that initializes the redirect or to the redirect target url the url that initiates the redirect may be kept to show up in search results as the redirect indicates a temporary nature under certain circumstances it was possible to exploit this behaviour by applying temporary redirects to well ranking urls leading to a replacement of the original url in search results by the url that initialized the redirect therefore stealing the ranking this method was usually combined with sneaky redirects to re target the user stream from the search results to a target page search engines have developed

unvalidated redirects and forwards cheat sheet date 21 august 2014 publisher open web application security project owasp ref because modern browsers always show the real url in the address bar the threat is lessened however redirects can also take you to sites that will otherwise attempt to attack in other ways for example a redirect might take a user to a site that would attempt to trick them into downloading antivirus software and ironically installing a trojan horse computing trojan of some sort instead removing code referer code information when a link is clicked the browser sends along in the http request a field called http referer referer which indicates the source of the link this field is populated with the url of the current web page and will end up in the server log logs of the server serving the external link since sensitive pages may have sensitive urls for example code nowiki http company com plans for the next release of our product nowiki code it is not desirable for the code referer code url to leave the organization a redirection page that performs referer referrer hiding referrer hiding could be embedded in all external urls transforming for example code nowiki http externalsite com page nowiki code into code nowiki http redirect company com http externalsite com page nowiki code this technique also eliminates other potentially sensitive information from the referer url such as the session id and can reduce the chance of phishing by indicating to the end user that they passed a clear gateway to another site implementation several different kinds of response to the browser will result in a redirection these vary in whether they affect http headers or html content the techniques used typically depend on the role of the person implementing it and their access to different parts of the system for example a web author with no control over the headers might use a meta refresh refresh meta tag whereas a web server administrator redirecting all pages on a site is more likely to use server configuration manual redirect the simplest technique is to ask the visitor to follow a link to the new page usually using an html anchor like source lang html4strict please follow a href http www example com this link a source this method is often used as a fall back nbsp if the browser does not support the automatic redirect the visitor can still reach the target document by following the link http status codes 3xx in the http protocol computing protocol used by the world wide web a redirect is a response with a list of http status codes

also remove legitimate edits and comments and may not be an effective method to reduce spam recently url redirection services have taken to using ajax as an efficient user friendly method for creating

have been heavily used referrer masking redirection services can hide the referrer by placing an intermediate page between the page the link is on and its destination although these are conceptually similar to other url redirection services they serve a different purpose and they rarely attempt to shorten or obfuscate the destination url as their only intended side effect is to hide referrer information and provide a clear gateway between other websites this type of redirection is often used to prevent potentially malicious links from gaining information using the referrer for example a session id in the query string many large community websites use link redirection on external links to lessen the chance of an exploit that could be used to steal account information as well as make

in 1992 as part of the darpa tipster program tipster text program its purpose is to support and encourage research within the information retrieval community by providing the infrastructure necessary for large scale evaluation of text retrieval methodologies and to increase the speed of lab to product technology transfer transfer of technology each track has a challenge wherein nist provides participating groups with data sets and test problems depending on track test problems might be questions topics or target extractable features pattern recognition features uniform scoring is performed so the systems can be fairly evaluated after evaluation of the results a workshop provides a place for participants to collect together thoughts and ideas and present current and future
